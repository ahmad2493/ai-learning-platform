We are living in a physical world where we observe many natural phenomena and objects around us such as Sun, stars, moon, oceans, plants, winds, rains, etc. People have always been curious to know the reality of such happenings. This has led certain people to investigate the facts and laws working in this world. This field of observation and experimentation to understand about the world around us is known as science. Everything in our lives is closely linked to science and the discoveries made by the scientists. In order to obtain reliable results from experiments, the primary thing is to make accurate measurements.

Physical quantities and their measurements have always been the matter of interest for the scientists. They have been investigating to improve the methods and instruments for accurate measurements of the physical quantities. In this chapter, we will discuss physical quantities, their measurements and related contents.

## 1.1 Physical and Non-Physical Quantities

We describe various natural phenomenon, events and human behaviour using some of their features and terms such as love, affection, fear, wisdom, beauty, length, volume, density, time, temperature, etc. Some of these can be measured directly and indirectly using some tools and instruments such as length of an object using a ruler, time duration of an event using a clock, the temperature (the degree of hotness) of somebody using a thermometer.

## Quick Quiz

## 1.2 Base and Derived Physical Quantities

Physics is a science of physical world where we interact with many measurable features known as physical quantities such as length,breadth, thickness, mass, volume, density, time, temperature,etc. Out of these, the scientists have selected arbitrarily some quantities to play a key role. They are called base quantities. All the quantities which can be described in terms of one or more base quantities are called derived physical quantities. For example, speed is a derived quantity which depends on distance and time which are base quantities whereas c density of a material is described in terms of mass and volume.

## Measurement of a Physical Quantity

A measurement is a process of comparison of an unknown quantity with a widely accepted standard quantity.

## Activity1.1

The teacher should facilitate this activity and initiate discussion as per direction.

be repeated by four or five students.Are all the measurements same? If they differ, then why?What isthesolution to avoid confusion?

In the early days people used to measure length using hand or arm, foot or steps. This measurement may result in confusion as the measurement of different people may differ from each other because of different sizes of their hands, arms or steps. To avoid such confusion, there is a need of a standard so that measurement by any person may result the same. This standard of measurement is known as a unit.

A measurement consists of two parts, a number and a unit. A measurement without unit is meaningless.

Not very far in the past, every country in the world had its own units of measurements. However, problems were faced when people

of different countries exchanged scientific information or traded with other countries using different units. Eventually, people got the idea of standardizing the units of measurements which could be used by all countries for efficient working and growth of mutual trade, business and share scientific information.

## 1.3 International System of Units

The international committee on weights and measures in 1961 recommended the use of a system consisted of seven base units known as international system of units, abbreviated as Sl. This system is in use all over the world.

Use of Sl measurements helps all scientists to share and compare their observations and results easily. The seven base units are given in Table 1.2. Their values are fixed with reference to international standards.

## Derived Units

Base units cannot be derived from one another and neither can they be resolved into anything more basic. While the units of derived quantities such as speed, area, volume, force, pressure and electric charge can be derived using the base units. These units are called derived units.

The units which can be expressed in termsofbase units arecalled derived units.

Forexample, Area = lengthxbreadth

=metrexmetre

= square metre

- =metre²orm²

| 7.          | Plane angle       | radian           | rad         |

## Quick Quiz

Speed = Distance/Time = metre/second = ms(a) Write the unit of charge in terms of base unit ampere A few derived units with specific names and and second. symbols are given in Table 1.3.

## SI Prefixes

- (b) Express the unit of pressure "pascal" in some otherunits.

The Sl is a decimal system. Prefixes are used to write units by powers of 10. The big quantities like 50000000 m and small quantities like 0.00004 m are not convenient to write down. The use of prefixes makes them simple. The quantity 50000000 m can be written as 5 x 10' m. Similarly, the quantity 0.00004 m can be written as 4 ×10- m

Prefixes are the words or symbols added before Sl unit such as milli, centi, kilo, mega, giga (Table1.4). The prefixes given in Table 1.4 should be known for use of Sl units effectively. Forexample, one thousandth (1/10o0) of a metre is millimetre. The thickness of a thin wire can be expressed convenientlyin millimetres whereas a long distance is expressed in kilometres which is 1000 metres.

Multiples and sub-multiples of mass measurement are given in Table 1.5 following examples will explain the meaning of prefixes.

$$\underline { 5 0 0 0 }$$

$$( 1 ) \ 5 0 0 \ m m = \frac { 5 0 0 0 } { 1 0 0 0 } \ m = 5 \, m 
 ( i i ) \ 5 0 0 0 \ c m = \frac { 5 0 0 0 } { 1 0 0 } \ m = 5 0 0 \, m 
 ( i i ) \ 3 0 0 g \ = \frac { 3 0 0 0 } { 1 0 0 0 } \ k g \ = 3 \, k g 
 ( i v ) \ 2 0 0 \, \mu s = \, 2 0 0 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } s = 2 \, x \, 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \, s 
 = 2 \, m s$$

## 1.4 Scientific Notation

It is short way of representing very large or very small numbers. Writing otherwise, the values of these quantities, take up much space They are difficult to read, their relative sizes are difficult to visualize and they are awkward to use in calculations. Their decimal places are more conveniently expressed as powers of 10. The numerical part of the quantity is written as a number from 1 to 9 multiplied by whole number powers of 10. To write numbers using scientific notation, move the decimal point until only one non-zero digit remains on the left.Then count the number of places through which the decimal point is moved and use this number as the power or exponents of 10. The average distance from the Sun to the Earth is 138,000,000 km. In scientific notation, this distance would be written as 1.38 x 10° km. The number of places, decimal moved to the left is expressed as a positive exponent of 10.

Diameter of hydrogen atom is about 0.000,000,000,052 m. To write this number in scientific notation, the decimal point is moved 11 places to the right. As a result, the diameter is written as 5.2x 10-11 m. The number of places moved by the decimal to the right is expressed as a negative exponent of 10.

## For Your Information!

Addition and subtraction of numbers is only possible if they have the same exponents.If they do not have the same exponents, make them equal by the displacement of the position of the decimal point.

## For Your Information!

Use of Sl units require special care, particularly in writing prefixes.

- Each unit is represented by a symbol not by an abbreviation. For example, for Sl not S.l., for second s not sec,for ampere A notamp,for gram g not gm.
- Symbols do not take plural form. Forexample, 10 mN, 100 N, 5 kg, 60s.
- Full name ofunit doesnotbegin with capital letter.For example, metre,second,newton except Celsius.
- Symbols appear in lower case, m for metre, s for second, exception is onlyL forlitre.
- Symbols named after scientist's + namehaveinitial letterscapital. For example,N fornewton,Kfor kelvin and Pa for pascal.
- Prefix is written before and close to Sl unit. Examples:ms, mm, mN, not ms, m m, m N.
- Units are written one space apart. Forexample, N m, N s.
- Compound prefixes are not allowed.Forexample,
- (i) 7 μus should be written as 7 ps.
- (ii) 5 × 10 cm should be written as 5×10²m.

Use of Sl units require special care, particularly in writing prefixes.

- Each unit is represented by a symbol not by an abbreviation. For example, for Sl not S.l., for second s not sec,for ampere A notamp,for gram g not gm.
- Symbols do not take plural form. Forexample, 10 mN, 100 N, 5 kg, 60s.
- Full name ofunit doesnotbegin with capital letter.For example, metre,second,newton except Celsius.
- Symbols appear in lower case, m for metre, s for second, exception is onlyL forlitre.
- Symbols named after scientist's + namehaveinitial letterscapital. For example,N fornewton,Kfor kelvin and Pa for pascal.
- Prefix is written before and close to Sl unit. Examples:ms, mm, mN, not ms, m m, m N.
- Units are written one space apart. Forexample, N m, N s.
- Compound prefixes are not allowed.Forexample,
- (i) 7 μus should be written as 7 ps.
- (ii) 5 × 10 cm should be written as 5×10²m.

The smallest measurement that can be taken with a metre rule is 1 mm. One millimetre is known as least countof the metre rule.

Least count is the smallest measurement that can be taken accurately with an instrument.

To measure the length of an object, the metre rule is placed in such a way that its zero coincides one edge of the object and then the reading in front of the other edge is the length of the object. One common source of error comes from the angle at which an instrument is read. Metre ruler should either be tipped on its edge or read when the

person's eye is directly above the ruler as shown in Fig. 1.1 at point B. If the metre ruler is read from an angle, such as from point A or C, the object will appear to be of different length. This is known as parallax error.

## Vernier Callipers

It is an instrument used to measure small lengths down to 1/10th ofa millimetre. It can be used to measure the thickness, diameter, width or depth of an object. The two scales on it are:

- (a) A main scale which has marking of 1mm each.
- (q) A Vernier (sliding) scale of length 9 mm and it is divided into 10 equal parts.

Least count of a Vernier Callipers is the difference between one main scale division (M.S) and one Vernier scale (V.S) division.

Hence, Least count = 1 M.S div- 1V.S div

= 1mm-0.9mm =0.1 mm

Usually, the least count is found by dividing the length of one small division on main scale by the

## For YourInformation!

Parallax error is due to incorrect position of eye when taking measurements. It can be avoided by keeping eye perpendicular to the scale reading.

There are twoJaws A and B to measure external dimension of an object whereas jaws C and D are used to measure internal dimension of an object. A narrow strip that projects from behind the main scale known as tail or depth gauge is used to measure the depths of a hollow object.

## Measurement Using Vernier Callipers

Suppose, an object is placed between the two jaws, the position of the Vernier scale on the main scale is shown in Fig. 1.3.

1. Read the main scale marking just infront of zero of the Vernier scale. It shows 4.3 cm.
2. Find the Vernier scale marking or division which is in line with any of the main scale marking. This shows:

Length of object = Main scale reading + (Least count x Vernier scale reading).

=4.3+0.01x4=4.34cm

3. Checking for zero error. Following are some important points to keep in mind before checking zero error:
2. (a) If on joining the jaws A and B, the zeros of the main scale and Vernier scale do not exactly coincide with each other then there is an error in the instrument called zero error.

<!-- image -->

- (b) If the zero of the Vernier scale is on the right side of the zero of the main scale (Fig. 1.4-a) then this instrument will show slightly more than the actual length.Hence,these zero errors are subtracted from the observed measurement.

To find the zero error, note the number of the division of the Vernier scale which is exactly in front of any division of the main scale. Multiply this number with the least count. The resultant number is the zero error of this instrument. The observed reading is corrected by subtracting the zero error from it.

- (c) If the zero of the Vernier scale is on the left side of the zero of the main scale (Fig. 1.4b), then instrument will show slightly less than the actual length.

- Do not taste any chemical unless otherwise instructed by the teacher.
- Do not eat, drink or play in the laboratory.
- Do not tamper with the electrical mains and other fittings in the laboratory. Never work with electricity near water.
- Don't place flammable substance near naked flames.
- Wash your hands after all laboratory work.

## Activity 1.2

The teacher should facilitate toperform this activity by making groups. Each group should place ten coins one above the other. Record theirtotal height using a metre rule. Divide by 10.

Whatis the thicknessof one coin?

What is the result?

Hence, the zero error is added in the observed measurement. For example, if 3 is the number of divisions coinciding with any main scale division then 3is subtracted from 10 and the result is then multiplied with the least count. Therefore, the zero error in this case will be 0.7 mm. For correction, it is added in the observed reading.

## Micrometer Screw Gauge

Now find the thickness of one coin using VernierCallipers.

Each group should comment on the measurement using the two instruments.

It is used to measure very small lengths such as diameter of a wire or thickness of a metal sheet. It has two scales:

- (b) The circular scaleon the thimble which has 50 divisions.Some instruments may have main scale marking of 1 mm and 100 divisions on the thimble.
- (a) The main scale on the sleeve which has markings of 0.5 mm each.

When the thimble makes one complete turn, the spindle moves 0.5 mm (1 scale division) on the main scale which is called pitch of the screw gauge. Thus, its least countis:

$$\text {its least count is} \colon & & \text {Pitch of the screw gauge} & = \frac { 0 . 5 \, m m } { 5 } \colon 0 . 0 1 \, m m \\ \text {Least count} & = \frac { \text {Pitch of the screw gauge} } { N \text {, of divisions on the circular scale} } & = \frac { 0 . 5 \, m m } { 5 0 } \colon 0 . 0 1 \, m m \\ \text {The parts of the screw gauge are shown in Fig. 1.5.}$$

<!-- image -->

## Checking for Zero Error

If the zero of the circular scale coincides with horizontal line, there is no zero error (Fig. 1.6-a).

If it is not exactly in front of the horizontal line of the main scale on joining the anvil and spindle then there is a zero error in the screw gauge (Fig. 1.6-b). If zero of the circular scale is below the horizontal line then it will measure slightly more than the actual thickness and hence, zero error will be subtracted from the observed measurement.

If the zero of the circular scale is above the horizontal line (Fig. 1.6-c), then it will show slightly less than the actual thickness and hence, the zero error will be added to the observed measurement.

## Measurement Using Screw Gauge

Suppose when a steel sheet is placed in between the anvil and spindle,the position of circular scale is shown in Fig.1.7.

- (a) Read the marking on the sleeve just before the thimble. It shows 6.5 mm.
- (q) Read the circular scale marking

which is in line with the main scale. This shows 25. Hence, Thickness = main scale reading + (circular scale reading x L.C.)

- = 6.5 mm + 25 x 0.01 mm
- = 6.5 mm + 0.25mm = 6.75 mm

## Activity 1.3

The teacher should facilitate the activity bymaking groups and ask them to find the thickness of 100 sheets of a textbook using a micrometre screw gauge. Dividing this thickness by 100, estimate the thickness of one sheet.

## Activity1.4

The teacher should help each group to make a paper scale having least count 0.2 cm and 0.5 cm.

## 1.6 Mass Measuring Instruments

## Physical Balance

There are many kinds of balances used for measuring mass of an object. In our daily life, we use the term weight instead of mass. In Physics, they have different meanings. Mass is the measure of quantity of matter in a body whereas theweight is the force bywhich the body is attracted towards the Earth. Weight can be measured using spring balance (Fig. 1.8). The mass of an object is found by comparing it with known standard masses. This process is called weighing. In laboratories, we use physical balance shown in Fig. 1.9 which is based on the principle of levers. The process of measurement is given below:

- 1.Level base of the balance using levelling screws until the plumb line is exactly above the pointed mark.
2. Turn the knob so that the pans of the balance are raised up. Is the beam horizontal and pointer at the centre of the scale? If not, turn the balancing screws on the beam so that it becomes horizontal.
3. Place the object to be weighed on the left pan.
4. Place the known weight from the weight box in the right pan using forceps.
- 5.Adjust the weight so that pointer remains on zero or oscillates equally on both sides of the zero of the scale.
6. The total of standard masses (weights) is a measure of the mass of the object in the left pan.

## 1.7 Time Measuring Instruments

## Stopwatch

The duration of time of an event is measured by a stopwatch as shown in Fig. 1.10. It contains two needles, one for seconds and other for minutes. The dial is divided usually into 30 big divisions each being further divided into 10 small divisions. Each small division represents one tenth (1/10) of a second. Thus, one tenth of a second is the least count of this

<!-- image -->

stopwatch. While using, a knob present on the top of the device is pressed. This results in the starting of the watch. The same knob is again pushed to stop it. After noting the reading, the same knob is again pressed to bring back the needles to the zero position. Now-a-days,electronic/digital watches (Fig. 1.11) are also available which can measure one hundredth part of a second.

## Activity 1.5Model ofa sandclock

The teacher should arrange the required articles and help students to make a model of a sandclock as shown in the figure.Using two glass funnels,adhesive tape,two lids,and dry sand.Observe howmuch time it takes for the sand to flow down once completely. Make a paper scale from this and paste on the glass funnels along straight side.

## 1.8 Volume Measuring Instruments

## Measuring Cylinder

It is a cylinder made of glass or transparent plastic with a scale divided in cubic centimetres (cm² or cc) or millilitres (mL) marked on it. It is used to find the volume of liquids and non-dissolvable solids.

The level of liquids in the cylinder is marked to find the volume. In order to read the volume correctly, the cylinder must be placed on a horizontal surface and the eye shall be kept in level with meniscus of water surface as shown in Fig. 1.12. The meniscus is the top level of the liquid surface. Water in the cylinder curves downward and its surface is called concave surface.The reading is taken

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

corresponding to the bottom edge of the surface. The mercury in the cylinder curves upward. Its surface is convex and the reading is taken corresponding to the top edge. The cylinder can be used to find the volume of solids.

## Activity1.6

The teacher should facilitate the groupstoperform this activity following the given instructions.

1. Take a liquid in which the given solid does not dissolve.
2. Note the initial position of liquid surface.
3. Put the solid in the cylinder containing liquid.
4. Note again the position of liquid surface in the cylinderwhich rises due to solid.
5. The difference of the two readings is the volume of the solid.

<!-- image -->

## Displacement Can Method

If the body does not fit into the measuring cylinder, then an overflow can or displacement can of wide opening is used as shown in Fig. 1.13. Place the displacement can on the horizontal table. Pour water in it until it starts overflowing through its opening. Now tie a piece of thread to the solid body and

<!-- image -->

lower it gently into the displacement can. The body displaces water which overflows through the side opening. The water or liquid is collected in a beaker and its volume is s measured by the measuring cylinder. This is equal to the volume of solid body.

## Activity1.7

The teacher should facilitate the groups to take a metallic ball or a pendulum bob. Measure its diameter and thenvolumebyplacingitinbetween twowooden blocks alongside a ruler.Then use measuring cylinder and comment on the result of this two onset activities.

## 1.9 Errors in Measurements

## For Your Information!

Measurements using tools and instruments are never perfect. They inherit some errors and differ from their truevalues.The best we shall do is to ensure that the errors are as small as reasonably possible.A scientific

The symbol of the base units are universal independent of the language used in the written text.

Caution:While taking a reading, keep your eye in front and in line with the lower meniscus of the water.

## Do You Know?

Ancient Chinese used to estimate the volume of grains by sounding their containing vessels.

measurement should indicate the estimated error in the measured values. Usually, there are three types of experimental errors affecting the measurements.

## (i) Human Errors (ii) Systematic Errors (ii) Random Errors

## (i) Human Errors

They occur due to personal performance. The limitation of the human perception such as the inability to perfectly estimate the position of the pointer on a scale.Personalerrorscan also arise dueto faulty procedure toread the scale. The correct measurement needs to line up your eye right in front of the level. In timing experiments, the reaction time of an individual to start or stop clock also affects the measured value.Human error can be reduced by ensuring proper training, techniques and procedure to handle the instruments and avoiding environmental distraction or disturbance for proper focusing. The best way is to use automated or digital instruments to reduce the impactof human errors.

## (ii) Systematic Errors

They refer to an effect that influences all measurements of particular measurements equally. It produces a consistence difference in reading. It occurs due to some definite rule. It may occur due to zero error of instrument, poor calibration of instrument or incorrect marking.The effect of this kind of error can be reduced by comparing the instrument with another which is known to be more accurate. Thus, a correction factor can be applied.

## (i) F Random Errors

It is said to occur when repeated measurements of a quantity give different values under the same conditions. It is due to some unknown causes which are unpredictable.

The experimenter have a little or no control over it. Random error arise due to sudden fluctuation or variation in the environmental conditions. For example, changes in temperature, pressure, humidity, voltage, etc. The effect of random errors can be reduced using several or multiple readings and then taking their average or mean value. Similarly,for the measuring time period of oscillating pendulum, the time of several oscillations, say 30 oscillations is noted and then mean or average value of one oscillation is determined.

## Quick Quiz

Identify Personal,Systematic and Random errors:

1. Your eye level may move a bit while reading the meniscus.
2. Air current may cause the balance tofluctuate.
3. The balance may not be properly calibrated.
4. Some of the liquid may have evaporated while it is being measured.

## 1.10 Uncertainty in a Measurement

There is no such thing as a perfect measurement. Whenever a physical quantity is measured except counting, there is inevitably some uncertainty about its determined value due to some instrument. This uncertainty may be due to use of a number of reasons. One reason is the type of instrument being used. We know that every measuring instrument is calibrated to a certain smallest division and this fact puts a limit to the degree of accuracy which can be achieved while measuring with it. Suppose that we want to measure the length of a straight line with the

<!-- image -->

help of a metre rule calibrated in millimetres. Let the end point of the line lies between 10.3 cm and 10.4 cm marks. By convention, if the end of the line does not touch or cross the midpoint of the smallest division, the reading is confined to the previous division. In case the end of the line seems to be touching or have crossed the midpoint, the reading is extended to the next division.Thus, in this example, the maximum uncertainty is ± 0.05 cm. It is, infact, equivalent to an uncertainty of 0.1 cm equal to the least count of the instrument divided into two parts, half above and half below the recorded reading.

The uncertainty or accuracy in the value of a measured quantity can be indicated conveniently by using significant figures.

The uncertainty in small length such as diameter of a wire and short finding average value.For example, the average time of one oscillation of a simple pendulum is usually found by measuring the time for thirty oscillations.

## 1.11 Significant Figures

We can count the number of candies in a jar and know it exactly by s include uncertainties depending upon the refinement of the instrument which is used for measurement.

It is important to reflect the degree of uncertainty in a measurement by recording the observation in significant figures.

The significant figures or digits are the digits of a measurement which are reliably known.

Figure 1.14 shows a rod whose length is measured with a ruler. Themeasurement shows the length in between4.6 cm and 4.7 cm.Since the length

<!-- image -->

of the rod is slightly more than 4.6 cm but less than 4.7 cm, so the first student estimates it to be 4.6 cm whereas the second student takes it as 4.7 cm. The first student thinks that the edge is nearer to 6 mm mark whereas the

second student considers the edge of the rod nearer to 7 mm mark. It is difficult to decide what is the true length.

Both students agree on digit 4 but the next digit is doubtful which has been determined by estimation only

and has a probability of error. Therefore, it is known as a doubtful digit. In any measurement, the accurately known digits and the first doubtful digit are known-as significant figures.

The following points are to be kept in mind while determining the number of significant figures in any data. All digits from 1 to 9 are significant. However,

- (a) A zero between two digits is considered significant. For example in 5.06m, the number of significant figures is 3.
- (b) Zeros on the left side of the measured value are not significant. For example, in 0.0034 m, the number of significant figures is 2.
- (c) Zeros on the right side of a decimal are considered significant. For example, in 2.40 mm the significant digits are 3.
- (d) If numbers are recorded in scientific notation, then all the digits before the exponent are significant.For example,in3.50x 10m, the significant figures are3.

## QuickQuiz

How many significant figures are there in each of the following?

(b) 12.5cm

(a)1.25×10²m

## 1.12 Precision and Accuracy

A physical measurements should be precise as well as accurate. These are two separate concepts and need clear distinction. Generally, precision of a measurement refers to how close togethera group of measurements actually are to each other. Accuracy of a measurement refers how close the measured value is to some accepted or true value.

(Fig. 1.15-b). Consistently hitting near the centre of bullseye indicates both precision and accuracy (Fig. 1.15-c). When these concepts are applied to measurements, the precision is determined by the instrument being used for measurement. The smaller the least count, the more precise is the measurement. A measurement is accurate if it correctly reflects the size of the object being measured.Accuracy depends on fractional uncertainty in the measurement. Infact, it is relative measurement which is important. The smaller the size of physical quantity, the more precise instrument is needed to be used. The accuracy of measurement is reflected by the number of significant figures, the larger is the number of significant figures, the higher is the accuracy.

## 1.13 Rounding off the Digits

When rounding off numbers to a certain number of significant figures, do so to the nearest value. If the last digit is more than 5, the retained digit is increased by one and if it is less than 5, it is retained as such.

## For example:

- (i) Round off to 2 significant figures: 2.512 x 10² m.

Answer:2.5 x 10² m

- (ii) Round off to 3 significant figures: 3.4567 x 104 kg.

Answer: 3.46x 104 kg

For the integer 5, there is an arbitrary rule:

If the number before the 5 is odd, one is added to the last digit retained.

If the numberbefore the 5 is even, it remains the same:

## For example:

- (i) Round off to 2 significant figures: 4.45 × 10² m.

- (ii) Round offto 2 significant figures: 4.55 x 10² m.

Answer: 4.4 x 10² m

Answer: 4.6 x 10² m

Sometimes, logic is applied to decide the fate of a digit. If we round off to 2 significant figures 4.452 × 10² m, the answer should be 4.5 × 10² m since 4.452x 10²m is more closer to 4.5x 10² m than 4.4x 10² m.

[Students should just be aware that this phenomenon is true; they do not need to study limit].

Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the motion of objects and the forces that change it.

Generally, mechanics is divided into two branches:

## 2.Dynamics

## 1.Kinematics

Kinematics is the study of motion of objects without referring to forces. On the other hand, dynamics deals with forces and their effect on the motion of objects.

In our everyday life, we observe many objects in motion. For example, cars, buses, bicycles, motorcycles s moving on the roads, aeroplanes flying through air, water flowing in canals or some object falling from the table to the ground.

The motion of these objects can be studied with or without considering the force which causes motion in them or changes it.

## 2.1 Scalars and Vectors

Before we study kinematics in detail, we should know about the nature of various physical quantities. Some quantities are called scalars and the others vectors.

A scalar is that physical quantity which can be described completely by its magnitude only.

Magnitude includes a number and an appropriate unit. When we ask a quantity we want. It is the magnitude of mass of sugar. Mass is a scalar quantity. Some other examples of scalar quantities are distance, length, time, speed, energy and temperature. Scalar quantities can be added up like numbers.

For example, 5 metres + 3 metres = 8metres. On the other hand,

A vector is that physical quantity which needs magnitude as well as direction to describe it completely.

The examples of vector quantities are displacement, velocity. acceleration, weight, force, etc. The velocity of a car moving at 90 kilometre per hour (25 m s′) towards north can be represented by a vector. Velocity is a vector quantity because it has magnitude 25 m s and direction (towards north). Vectors cannot be added like scalars. There are specific methods to add up vectors. These methods take their directions also into consideration.

## Representation of vectors

In the textbooks, symbol used fora vector is a bold face letter such as A, v, F and d etc. Since we cannot write in bold face script on paper, so a vector is written as the letter with a small arrow over it, i.e. A,, F, d. The magnitude of a vector is given by italic letter without arrow head. A vector can be represented scale while the direction of arrow indicates the direction of the vector.

To represent the direction, two mutually perpendicular lines are required. We can draw one line to represent east-west direction and the other line to represent θ E direction of a vector can be given with respect to these o lines. Mostly, we use any two lines which are perpendicular to each other. Horizontal line (x x) i called x-axis and vertical line (y y) is called y-axisA vector v making an angle θ S (Fig. 2.1-b). The point where these axes meet is known towardsnorth from east as origin. The origin is usually denoted by O. These axes are also called reference axes.

A vector is drawn starting from the origin of the reference axes towards the given direction. The direction is usually given by an angle θ (theta) with x-axis. The angle with x-axis is always measured from the right side of x-axis in the anti-clockwise direction.

## Example 2.1

Draw the velocityvectorv; a velocity of 300 m s at an angle of60°to the eastof north.

## Solution

- (i) Draw two mutually perpendicular lines indicating N, S, E &amp; W.

<!-- image -->

## For Your Information!

For geographical direction, the reference line is north - south whereas for Cartesian coordinate system +vex-axis is the reference.

- Select a suitable scale. If 100 m s = 1 cm, (i) then 300 m s' are represented by 3 cm line.
- (ii) )Draw3cm line OP at anAngleof 60° starting from N towards E.
- (iv) Make an arrow head at the end of line OP. The OP is the vectorv.

<!-- image -->

## Example 2.2

Draw a force vector F having magnitude of 350 N and acting at an angle of 60° with x-axis.

## Solution

- (i) Draw horizontal and vertical lines to represent x-axis and y-axis as shown in Fig. 2.3.
- (i) Scale:If100 N = 1 cm,then

350N=3.5cm

- (i) Draw 3.5 cm line 0Q at an angle of 60° with x-axis.
- (iv) Make an arrow head at the end of the line OQ. The OQ is thevector F.

## Resultant Vector

We can add two or more vectors to get a single vector. This is called as resultant vector. It has the same effect as the combined effect of all the vectors to be added. We have to determine both magnitude and direction of the resultant vector, therefore, it is quite different from that of scalar addition.One method of addition of vectors is the graphical method.

## Addition of Vectors by Graphical Method

Let us add two vectors v, and v, having magnitudes of 300 N and 400 N acting at angles of 30° and 60° with x-axis. By selecting a suitable scale 100 N = 1cm, we can draw the vectors as shown in Fig. 2.4 (a).

To add these vectors,we apply a rule called head-to-tail rule, which states that:

<!-- image -->

To add a number of vectors, redraw their representative lines such that the head ofone line coincideswith the tail ofthe other. The resultant vector is given by a single vector which is directed from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector.

Fig.2.3

Measured length of resultant vector is 6.8 cm (Fig.2.4-b). According to selected scale, magnitude of the resultant vectorv is 680 N and direction is angle 49°with x-axis.

We can find the resultantvector of more than two vectors by adding them with the same way applying head-to-tail rule.

## 2.2 Rest and Motion

<!-- image -->

When we look around us, we see many things like buildings, trees, electric poles, etc. which do not change their positions. We say that they are in a state of rest.

Fig. 2.5 (a)

<!-- image -->

If a body does not change its position with respect to its surroundings, itis said to be at rest.

Suppose a motorcyclist is standing on the road (Fig. 2.5-a). An observer sees that he is not changing his position with respect to his surroundings i.e., a nearby building, tree or a pole. He will say that the motorcyclist is at rest.

Now let us see what does motion mean? When the motorcyclist is driving (Fig. 2.5-b), the observer will notice that he is continuously changing his position with respect to the surroundings. Then the observer will say that the motorcyclist is in motion.

If a body continuously changes its position with respect to its surroundings, it is said to be in motion.

The state of rest or motion of a body is always relative. For example, a person standing in the compartment of a moving train is at rest with

Fig. 2.5 (b)

<!-- image -->

i ss respect to an observer standing on the platform of a railway station.

## 2.3 Types of Motion

We observe different types of motion in our daily life. A train moves almost along a straight line, the blades of a fan rotate about an axis, a swing vibrates about its mean position. Generally, there are three types of motion of bodies.

1. Translatory motion
2. Rotatory motion

## 1.Translatory Motion

If the motion of a body is such that every particle of the body moves uniformly in the same direction, it is called tanslatory motion. For example, the motion of a train or a car is tanslatory motion (Fig.2.6). Translatory motion can be of three types:

## (i) Linear Motion

If the body moves along a straight line, it is called linear motion. A freely falling body is the example of linear motion.

## (i) Random Motion

If the body moves along an irregular path (Fig. 2.7), the motion is called random motion.

## (ii) Circular Motion

## 3. Vibratory motion

Circular Motion Fig.2.8

<!-- image -->

(a) Irregular path Flg.2.7

<!-- image -->

The motion of a body along a circle is called circular motion. If a ball tied to one end of a string is whirled, it moves along a circle. A Ferris wheel is also an example of circular motion (Fig.2.8).

## 2.Rotatory Motion

If each point of a body moves around a fixed point (axis), the motion of this body is called rotatory motion. For example, the motion of an electric fan and the drum of a washing machine dryer is rotatory motion (Fig.2.9). The motion of a top is also rotatory motion.

## 3.Vibratory Motion

When a body repeats its to and fro motion about a fixed position, the motion is called vibratory motion. The motion of a swing in a children park is vibratory motion (Fig. 2.10).

Fig.2.10

Vibratory motion

## 2.4 Distance and Displacement

We know that motion is the action of an object going from one place to another or change of position. The length between the original and final positions may be measured in two ways as either distance or displacement.

## The distance is the length of actual path of the motion.

Let a person be travelling from Lahore to Multan in a car. On reaching Multan, he reads the speedometer and notices that he has travelled a distance of 320 km. It is the distance travelled by that person. Obviously, it is not the shortest distance from Lahore to Multan, as the car took many turns in the way. He did not travel along a straight line.

The displacement of an object is a vector quantity whose magnitude is the shortest distance between theinitial and final positionsofthemotion and its direction is from the initial position to the final position.

We can also call this as the change in position. Note that displacement is a vector quantity whereas distance is a scalar quantity.Following example will explain the difference between distance and displacement.

<!-- image -->

Suppose a car travels from a position A to B. The curved line is the actual path followed by the car (Fig. 2.11). The total distance covered by the car will be equal to the length of the curved line AB. The displacement d is the straight line AB directed from A to B as indicated by the arrow head. The Sl unit for the displacement is the same as that of distance.

## 2.5 Speed and Velocity

<!-- image -->

The car while moving on a circular road may have constant speed, but its velocity is changing at every instant.Why?

We are often interested to know how fast a body is moving. For this purpose, we have to find the distance covered in unit time which is known as speed. lf a body covers a distance S in time t, its speed vwill be written as:

Fig.2.11

<!-- image -->

The fastest land mammal (cheetah) and the fastest fish (sailfish) have the samehighest recorded speed of 110kmh1.

<!-- image -->

The speed is a scalar quantity. The Sl unit of speed is m s' or km h-1.

It is obvious that speed of a vehicle does not remain constant throughout the journey. lf the reading of the speedometer of the vehicle is observed, it is always is called instantaneous speed. Practically we make use of the average speed. It is defined as:

$$A v e r g e s e d = \frac { \, \text {Total distance covered} } { \, \text {Total time taken} } \quad \text {or} \quad v _ { w } = \frac { 5 } { t }$$

## Example 2.3

An eagle dives to the ground along a 300m path with an average speed of 60 m s'. How long does it take to cover this distance?

## Solution

$$\begin{array} { r l } & { \text {Total distance covered} = S = 3 0 0 m } \\ & { \text {Average speed} = v _ { s v } = 6 0 m s ^ { - 1 } } \\ & { \text {Total time taken} = t = ? } \\ & { \text {Using the equation } v _ { s v } = \frac { s } { t } } \\ & { o r } & { t = \frac { s } { v _ { s v } } } \\ & { \text {putting the values } } & { t = 3 0 0 m / 6 0 m s ^ { 1 } = } \end{array}$$

putting the values st=300m/60ms²=5s

## Velocity

The speed of an object does not tell anything about the direction of motion.To takeinto account the direction, thevector concept is needed.Forthis, we have to find the displacement d between the initial and final positions.

The net displacement of a body in unit time is called velocity.

If a body moves from point A to B along a curved path as shown in Fig.2.11, the displacement d is the straight line AB, then

$$\ A v e c { \ v e c { \iota } } = \frac { \ D i s p l a c { \i m e n t } } { \ T i m } \quad \text {or} \quad \mathbf v _ { \mathbf w } = \frac { \text {d} } { t } .$$

Velocity is a vector quantity. The Equation (2.2) shows that the direction of velocity v is the same as that of displacement d. The SI unit of velocity is also m s-1 or km h-'. Consider the example of a car moving towards north at the rate of 70 km h-.To differentiate between speed and velocity, we shall say that the speed

## ForYour lnformation!

<!-- image -->

of car is 70 km h- which is a scalar quantity. The velocity of the car is a vector quantity whose magnitude is 70 km h- and is directed towards north.

## Uniform and Non-uniform Velocity

The velocity is said to be uniform if the speed and direction of a moving body does not change. If the speed or direction or both of them change, it is known as variable velocity or non-uniform velocity.

Practically, a vehicle does not move in a straight line direction frequently. The example of a body moving with uniform velocity is the downward motion of a

few moments. Then the parachute opens. At this stage the force of gravity acting downwards on the paratrooper is balanced by the resistance of air on the parachute that acts upward. Consequently, the paratrooper moves down with uniform velocity.

## 2.6 Acceleration

Whenever the velocity of an object is increasing, we say that the object is accelerating. For example, when a car overtakes another one, it accelerates to a greater velocity (Fig.2.12). In contrary to that the velocity decreases when brakes are applied to slow down a bicycle or a car. In both the cases, a change in velocity occurs.

While overtaking, a car accelerates to a greater velocity. Fig.2.12

<!-- image -->

## Acceleration is defined as the time rate of change of velocity.

The change in velocity can occur in magnitude or direction or both of them. The acceleration is positive if the velocity is increasing and it is negative if the velocity is decreasing. Negative acceleration is also called deceleration or retardation.

Acceleration is a vector quantity like velocity, but the direction of acceleration is that of change of velocity. If a body is moving with an initial velocity v, and after some time t its velocity changes to v, the change in velocity is △v = v,-v,that occurs in time t. In this case, rate of change of velocity i.e., acceleration will be average acceleration.

of car is 70 km h- which is a scalar quantity. The velocity of the car is a vector quantity whose magnitude is 70 km h- and is directed towards north.

Acceleration is a vector quantity like velocity, but the direction of acceleration is that of change of velocity. If a body is moving with an initial velocity v, and after some time t its velocity changes to v, the change in velocity is △v = v,-v,that occurs in time t. In this case, rate of change of velocity i.e., acceleration will be average acceleration.

Average acceleration=

$$a _ { x } = \frac { v _ { f } - v _ { 1 } } { t }$$

△v Equation (2.3) can be written as aav t The Sl unit of acceleration is m s-2.

If acceleration α is constant, then Eq 2.3 can be written as: Vf=v; + at

## Uniform and Non-uniform Acceleration

If time rate ofchange ofvelocity is constant, the acceleration is said to be uniform.

Fascinating Snap: This is a photograph of a falling apple dropped from som height. The images of apple are captured by the camera at 60 flashes per second. The widening spaces between the images indicate the acceleration of the apple.

If anyone of the magnitude or direction or both of them changes it is called variable or non-uniform acceleration. In this class, we will solve problems only for the motion of the bodies having uniform acceleration and not the variable acceleration.

## Example2.4

A plane starts running from rest on a run-way as shown in the figure below. It accelerates down the run-way and after 20 seconds attains a velocity of 252 km h-1. Determine the average acceleration of the plane.

## 2.7 Graphical Analysis of Motion

A graph is a pictorial diagram in the form of a straight line or a curve which shows the relationship between two physical quantities. Usually, we draw a graph on a paper on which equally spaced horizontal and vertical lines are drawn. Generally, every 10h line is a thick line on the graph paper. In order to draw a graph, two mutually perpendicular thick lines xox and yoy are selected as x and y axes as shown in Fig 2.13. The point where the

<!-- image -->

two axes intersect each other is known as origin O. Positive values along x-axis are taken to the right side of the origin and negative values are taken to the left side. Similarly, positive values along y-axis are taken above the origin whereas negative values are taken below the origin. Normally, the independent quantity is taken along x-axis and dependent variable quantity along y-axis. For example, in distance-time graph, t is independent and S is dependent variable. Therefore, t should be along x-axis and S along y-axis.

To represent a physical quantity along any axis, a suitable scale is chosen by considering the minimum and maximum values of the quantity.

## Distance-Time Graph

Distance-time graph shows the relation between distance S and time t taken by a moving body.

Let a car be moving in a straight line on a motorway. Suppose that we measure its distance from starting point after every one minute, and record it in the table given below:

| Time t (min)    |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |
|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Distance S (km) |   0 | 1.2 | 2.4 | 3.6 | 4.8 |   6 |

## Follow the steps given below to draw a graph on a centimetre graph paper:

- (#) Take time talong x-axis and distance S along y-axis.
- (i) Select suitable scales (1 minute = 1 cm) along x-axis and (1.2 km =1 cm) along y-axis. The graph paper shown here is not to the scale.
- (i) Mark the values of each big division along x andy axes according to the scale.
- (iv) Plot all pairs of values of time and distance by marking points on the graph paper.
- (v) Join all the plotted points to obtain a best straight line as shown in Fig. 2.14. From the table,we can observe thatcar hascovered equal distance in equal intervals of time. This shows that the car moves with uniform speed. Therefore,a straight line graph

between time and distance represents motion with uniform speed.

| Time t (min)    |   0 |    1 |    2 |    3 |    4 |   5 |
|-----------------|-----|------|------|------|------|-----|
| Distance S (km) |   0 | 0.24 | 0.96 | 2.16 | 3.84 |   6 |

Table shows that speed goes on increasing in equal intervals of time. This is very obvious from the graph as shown in Fig. 2.15. The graph line is curved upward. This is the case when the body (car) is moving with certain acceleration.

Fig.2.15

## In another case, consider the following table:

| Time t(min)     |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |
|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Distance S (km) |   0 |   2 | 3.1 |   4 | 4.6 |   5 |

The graph line is curved downwards. This shows that distance travelled in the same interval of time goes on decreasing, so speed is decreasing. This is the case of motion with deceleration or negative acceleration as shown in Fig.2.16.

## Now consider another case.

<!-- image -->

| Time t(min)     |   0 | 1   |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |
|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Distance S (km) | 1.2 |     | 1.2 | 1.2 | 1.2 | 1.2 |

Graph line is horizontal in this case (Fig. 2.17). It shows that the distance covered by the car does not change with change in time. It means that the car is not moving;it is at rest.

## 2.8 Gradient of a Distance-Time Graph

The gradient is the measure of slope ofa line.

Consider the distance-time graph of uniform speed again. Select any two values of time t, and t Draw two vertical dotted lines at t, and t, on x-axis. These lines meet the graph at points P and Q. From these points draw horizontal lines to meet y-axis at S, and S, respectively as shown in Fig.2.18.

$$\begin{array} { r l } & { i g . 2 . \cdot } \\ & { D i s t a n c e \, c o v e r d \, i n \, t h i s \, t i m e } \\ & { i n t e r v i a l s \quad S _ { 2 } - S _ { 1 } = S } \\ & { i n t e r k a t e n \quad t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 } = t } \end{array}$$

<!-- image -->

The slope or gradient of the graph is the measure of tangent θof the triangle RPQ:

$$S l o p e = \frac { R Q } { P R }$$

$$\begin{array} { r l } { S l o p e } & \frac { S _ { 2 } - S _ { 1 } } { t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 } } = } \end{array}$$

From Eq. (2.1), S =V, the average speed during the time interval t. t

Figure 2.17 shows that S = tan θ = slope of graph line, therefore, t

Gradient of the distance-Time graph is equal to the average speed of the body.

## 2.9 Speed-Time Graph

Suppose we can note the speed of the same car after every one second and record it in the table given below, we can draw the graph between speed v versus time t. This is called speed-time graph.

| Table           |   Table |   Table |   Table |   Table |   Table |   Table |
|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Time t (s)      |       0 |       1 |       2 |       3 |       4 |       5 |
| Speed v (m s-1) |       0 |       8 |      16 |      24 |      32 |      40 |

## 2.8 Gradient of a Distance-Time Graph

The gradient is the measure of slope ofa line.

Consider the distance-time graph of uniform speed again. Select any two values of time t, and t Draw two vertical dotted lines at t, and t, on x-axis. These lines meet the graph at points P and Q. From these points draw horizontal lines to meet y-axis at S, and S, respectively as shown in Fig.2.18.

$$\begin{array} { r l } & { i g . 2 . \cdot } \\ & { D i s t a n c e \, c o v e r d \, i n \, t h i s \, t i m e } \\ & { i n t e r v i a l s \quad S _ { 2 } - S _ { 1 } = S } \\ & { i n t e r k a t e n \quad t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 } = t } \end{array}$$

<!-- image -->

The slope or gradient of the graph is the measure of tangent θof the triangle RPQ:

$$S l o p e = \frac { R Q } { P R }$$

$$\begin{array} { r l } { S l o p e } & \frac { S _ { 2 } - S _ { 1 } } { t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 } } = } \end{array}$$

From Eq. (2.1), S =V, the average speed during the time interval t. t

Figure 2.17 shows that S = tan θ = slope of graph line, therefore, t

Gradient of the distance-Time graph is equal to the average speed of the body.

## 2.9 Speed-Time Graph

Suppose we can note the speed of the same car after every one second and record it in the table given below, we can draw the graph between speed v versus time t. This is called speed-time graph.

| Table           |   Table |   Table |   Table |   Table |   Table |   Table |
|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Time t (s)      |       0 |       1 |       2 |       3 |       4 |       5 |
| Speed v (m s-1) |       0 |       8 |      16 |      24 |      32 |      40 |

Take t along x-axis and v along y-axis. Scale can be selected as 1 s = 1 cm (x-axis) and speed 10ms- = 1 cm alongy-axis.

Shape of the graph is shown in Fig. 2.19. It is a straight line rising upward. This motion with uniform acceleration. It is also evident from the table.

<!-- image -->

Now consider another case. The observations are recorded in the table given below:

|                         |      | Table   |      |      |   4 |      |
|-------------------------|------|---------|------|------|-----|------|
| Time t(s) Speedv (m s-) | 0 20 | 1 20    | 2 20 | 3 20 |  20 | 5 20 |

In this case, graph line is horizontal (Fig. 2.20) parallel to time x- axis. It shows that speed does not change with change in time. This is a motion with constant speed.

<!-- image -->

## 2.10 Gradient of a Speed-Time Graph

Now consider the speed-time graph (Fig. 2.21). The speeds at times t and t2 are V1 and v2 respectively. The change in speed in a time interval (t2 - t1) is (v2 -v1). Therefore,

$$o p e \ = \ \frac { \text {Change in speed} } { \text {Total time taken} }$$

$$\begin{array} { r l } { S l o p e = } & \frac { \text {Change in speed} } { T o t a n t i m e t a k e n } } \\ { o r \ S l o p e = } & \frac { ( v _ { 2 } - v _ { 1 } ) } { ( t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 } ) } } \\ { S l o p e = } & \frac { \Delta v } { t } } \\ { B u t \frac { \Delta v } { t } = a , t h e a r e a l e r a t i n . } & v \end{array}$$

Hence

<!-- image -->

Gradient of the speed-Time graph is equal to the average acceleration of the body.

This shows that when a car moves with constant acceleration, the velocity-time graph is a straight line which rises through same height for equal intervals of time.

time t is the same as speed vz at time tz, hence, the change in speed is also zero.

$$= \frac { 2 ( v _ { 2 } - v _ { 1 } ) } { ( t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 } ) } = 0$$

When the speed of the object is constant, the speed-time graph is a horizontal straight line parallel to time axis.

This shows that the acceleration

<!-- image -->

of this motion is zero. It isthe motion without the change in speed.

## 2.11 Area Under Speed-Time Graph

The distance moved by an object can also be determined by using its speed-time graph. For example, figure 2.23 shows that the object is moving with constant speed v.Fora time-interval t, the distance covered by the object as given by Eq.2.1is vxt.

This distance can also be found by calculating the area under the speed-time graph. The area under the graph for time interval t is the area of rectangle of sides t and v. This area is shown shaded in Fig.2.23 and is equal to v x t. Thus, area under speed-time graph up to the time axis is numerically equal to the distance covered by the object in time t.

Now consider another example shown in Fig.2.24.Here, the speed of the object increases uniformly from 0 to v in time t. The average speed is given by

$$v _ { a v } = \frac { 0 + v } { 2 } = \frac { 1 } { 2 } v 
 v _ { a v } = \frac { 0 + v } { 2 } = \frac { 1 } { 2 } v 
 \therefore \frac { 1 } { 2 } v = \frac { 1 } { 2 } v$$

<!-- image -->

Distance covered = average speed x time = 1/2 vx t. If we calculate the area under speed-time graph, it is equal to the area of the right-angled triangle shown shaded in Fig. 2.24. The base of the triangle is equal totand theperpendicularis equal tov. Area of a triangle = 1/2 (perpendicularx base)

$$= 1 / 2 \left ( v \times t \right )$$

<!-- image -->

We see that this area is numerically equal to the distance covered by the object during the time interval t. Therefore, we can say that:

The area under the speed-time graph up to the time axis is numerically equal to the distance covered by the object.

## 2.12 Solving Problems for Motion Under Gravity

Three equations of motion are used to solve problems for motion of bodies. If v, is the initial

The distance-time graph shows the motion of three cyclists.

- (a) What doeseach line on the graphrepresent?
- (b) Which cyclist travelled the most distance?
- (c) Which cyclist travelled at the greatest speed? the lowest speed? at constant speed?

velocity of the body, v, is the final velocity, t is the time taken, S is the distance covered and a is the acceleration, then:

$$v _ { f } = v _ { i } + a t \frac { } { 1 }$$

$$2 a 5 = v _ { f } ^ { 2 } - v _ { i } ^ { 2 } \quad \longrightarrow \quad ( 3 )$$

$$5 & = v _ { i } t + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \, a t ^ { 2 } \longrightarrow ( 2 ) \\ & = 1 - 2 \, ,$$

While applying these equations, the following assumptions are made:

- () Motion is always considered along a straight line
- Only the magnitudes of vector quantities are used.
- Acceleration is assumed to be uniform.
- (iv) The direction of initial velocity is taken as positive. Other quantities which are in the direction of initial velocity are taken as positive. The quantities in the direction opposite to the initial velocity are taken as negative.

## 2.13 Free Fall Acceleration

When a body is falling freely under the action of gravity of the Earth, the acceleration acting on it is the gravitational acceleration and is denoted by g. The direction of gravitational acceleration is always downwards. Its value is 9.8 m s-2,

<!-- image -->

Since the freely falling bodies move vertically downwards in a straight line with uniform acceleration g, so the three equations of motion can be applied to the motion of such bodies. While applying equations of motion, the acceleration a is replaced by g. Thus, equations of motion for freely falling bodies can be written as:

$$v _ { 1 } = v _ { 1 } + g t 
 = 2 g S = v _ { f } ^ { 2 } - v _ { i } ^ { 2 } 
 t a t h i l e u s i n g t h e s e = - 1 0 \times 2 0 
 \tan w h i l e u s i n g t h e s e$$

It should be remembered that while using these equations, the following points should be kept in mind:

- () If a body is released from some height to fall freely, its initial velocity v; will be taken as zero.
- (i) The gravitational acceleration g will be taken as positive in the downward direction. All other quantities will also be taken as positive in the downward direction. The quantities in the direction opposite to the acceleration will be taken as negative.
- (ii) If a body is thrown vertically upward, the value of g will be negative and the final velocity will be zero at the highest point.

## For Your Information!

Acceleration of free fall g is 10 ms-2 for all objects.

- (b) From the first equation of motion, we have

$$v _ { f } = v _ { i } \ + g t$$

## Example 2.6

An arrow is thrown vertically upward with the help of a bow. The velocity of the arrow when it leaves the bow is 30 m s1. Determine time to reach the highest point? Also, find the maximum height attained by the arrow.

## Solution

Here, acceleration will be taken as negative, for the arrow is thrown vertically upward.

$$( a ) & \text { according to second equation} , \\ & \quad S = v _ { i } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } g t ^ { 2 } \\ & \quad P tting the values, \ \ h = 0 \times 4 \, s + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \times 1 0 \, m \, s ^ { 2 } \times 4 ( 4 ) ^ { 2 } s ^ { 2 } \\ & \quad h = 8 0 \, m \quad \text { } 2 0 \, b \,$$

- (b) From the first equation of motion, we have

$$v _ { f } = v _ { i } \ + g t$$

## Example 2.6

An arrow is thrown vertically upward with the help of a bow. The velocity of the arrow when it leaves the bow is 30 m s1. Determine time to reach the highest point? Also, find the maximum height attained by the arrow.

## Solution

Here, acceleration will be taken as negative, for the arrow is thrown vertically upward.

## Relativity

In 1905, famous scientist Albert Einstein proposed his revolutionary theory of special relativity which modified many of the basic concepts of physics. According to this theory, speed of light is a universal constant. Its value is approximately 3 x10° m s'. Speed of light remains the same for all motions. Any This is known as universal speed limit.

If the position, velocity and acceleration were known at any time, then the position and velocity of the moving body at another time could be completely described.But one of the things leftout of this discussion was thecause of acceleration produced in the body. If a stone is dropped from a height, it is accelerated downward. It is because the Earth exerts a force of gravity on the stone that pulls it down. When we drive a car or motorcycle, the engine exerts a force which produces acceleration. We will observe that whenever there is acceleration, there is always that produce change in the motions of bodies.

## 3.1 Concept of Force

A common concept of a force is a push or a pull that starts, stops or changes the magnitude and direction ofvelocity of a body. We come across many forces in our daily life. Some of them we apply on other bodies and some are acting on us.For example, when we open a door, we push or pull it by applying force. When we are sitting in a car, we push against the seat as the car turns round a corner.

Fig.3.1

<!-- image -->

Force transfers energy to an object. Take the example of a man who moves force to push it (Fig.3.1). He applies a different amount of force on each handle when turning the wheelbarrow around the corner in order to keep it from tipping over. The examples of forces acting on us are the force of gravity acting downward, the force of friction which helps us to walk on the ground and many others.

## Types of Forces

There are two major types of forces:

1. Contact Forces

## 1. Contact Forces

A contact force is a force that is exerted by one object on the other at the point of contact. Applied forces (push a pull and twist) are contact forces. Some other examples of contact forces are the following:

## (i) Friction

It is the force that resists motion when the surface of one object comes in contact with the surface of another.

- 2.Non-contact Forces

## (i) Drag

The drag force is the resistant force caused by the motion of a body through a fluid. It acts opposite to the relative motion of any object moving with respect to surrounding fluid.

## (iii) Thrust

## (iv) Normal Force

It is an upward force exerted by a liquid on an object immersed in it. When we try to immerse an object in water, we feel an upward force exerted on the can float in the sea due to this force which balances the weight of the ship.

It is the force of reaction exerted by the surface on an object lying on it. This force acts outward and perpendicular to the surface. It is also called the support forceupon the object.

## (v) Air Resistance

## (vi) Tension Force

It is the resistance (opposition) offered by air when an object falls through it.

It is the force experienced by a rope when a person or load pulls it. (vii) Elastic Force being deformed. Examples are rubber bands, springs, trampoline, etc.

## 2. Non-contact Forces

not in physical contact. The non-contact forces can work from a distance. That is why, these are sometimes called as action-at-a-distance. There is always a field linked with a non-contact force. Due to this property, non-contact forces are also called field forces.A few examples of non-contact forces are described below:

## (i) Gravitational Force

S

An apple falling down from a tree is one of the best examples of gravitational force (Fig. 3.2). When we throw an object upward, it is the gravitational force of the Earth that brings it back to the Earth. In fact, the gravitational force is an attractive force that exists among all bodies which have mass. It is a long-range force given by Newton's law of gravitation:

$$F = G \frac { m _ { 1 } m _ { 2 } } { r ^ { 2 } } \quad \text {where} \, m _ { 1 } , \text { and } m _ { 2 } \text { are two }$$

masses distantrapart and Gisconstantof gravitation.Itsvalue is 6.67 x 10- N m² kg². The Sun's gravitational force keeps the Earth and all other planets of our solar system in fixed orbits.

$$\Gamma ^ { 2 }$$

Fig.3.2

<!-- image -->

Similarly, the gravitational force of the Earth keeps the moon in its orbit. It also keeps the atmosphere and oceans fixed to the surface of the Earth. Even an attractive force ofthe Earth also known as gravity.

## (i) Electrostatic Force

An electrostatic force acts between two charged objects. The opposite charges attract each other and similar charges repel each other as shown in Fig. 3.3. Like gravitational force, electrostatic force is also a long-range force.

## (ii) Magnetic Force

It is a force which a magnet exerts on other magnets and magnetic materials like iron, nickel and cobalt. You might have observed that iron pins attracted in the presence of a magnet without any physical contact (Fig. 3.4). Magnetic force between the poles of two magnets canbe either attractiveor repulsive. This can be observed very easily by bringing different poles of two magnets close to each other. Like poles repel and unlike poles attract each other.

## (iv) Strong and Weak Nuclear Forces

These are also non-contact forces acting between the subatomic particles. We will study these forces in the next section.

## 3.2 Fundamental Forces

There are four fundamental forces in nature.These are:

1. Gravitational force
3. Strong nuclear force
2. Electromagneticforce
4. Weaknuclearforce

Every force comes underanyofthese forces.

## Gravitational Force

The gravitational force has been discussed in the previous section. We often talk about this force. It is the weakest one among all four forces. Being a long range force, it extends to infinite distance although it becomes weaker and weaker.

## Electromagnetic Force

It is the force that causes the interaction between electrically charged particles. Electrostatic and magnetic forces come under this category. These are long-range forces. The areas in which these forces act are called electromagnetic fields.Electromagnetic forces are stronger than gravitational and weak

nuclear forces. This force causes all chemical reactions. It binds together atoms, molecules and crystals etc. At macroscopic level, it is a possible cause of friction between different surfaces in relative motion.

## Strong Nuclear Force

It holds the atomic nuclei together by binding the protons and neutrons in the nucleus over coming repulsive electromagneticforcebetweenpositively charged protons. It is also a short-range force with the order of 10-14m. If the distance between nucleons increases beyond this range, this force ceases to act.

## Weak Nuclear Force

Weak nuclear force is responsible for the disintegration of a nucleus. For example, the weak nuclear force executes the β-decay (beta decay) of a neutron, in which a neutron transforms into a proton (Fig.3.7). In the process, a β-particle (electron) and an uncharged particle called antineutrino are emitted. In other words, we can say that due to weak nuclear force radioactive decay of atoms occurs. However,

electromagnetic force.It is a short-range force of the order 10-1 m.

## Unification of Weak Nuclear and Electromagnetic Forces

A Pakistani scientist Dr. Abdus Salam along with Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg were awarded in 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for their contributions to the unification of the weak nuclear force and electromagnetic force as electroweak force. Although these two forces appear to be different in everyday phenomena, but the theory models them as two different aspects of the same force. Its effects are observed for the interactions taking place at very high energy.

Its effects are observed for the interactions taking place at very high energy.

## 3.3 Forces in a Free- Body Diagram

External forces acting on an object may include friction, gravity, normal force, drag, tension in a string or a human force due to pushing or pulling.

Suppose a book is pushed over the surface of a table top as shown in Fig.3.8(a). Then how can we represent the forces acting on the body using free-body diagram?

Free-body diagrams are used to show the relative magnitudes and directions of all the forces acting on an object in a given situation. In other words, a free-body diagram is a special example of the vector diagrams.

Usually, the object is represented by a box and the force arrows are drawn outward from the centre of the box in the directions of forces as shown in Fig.3.8(b). The length of a force arrow (line) reflects the magnitude of the force and the arrow head indicates the direction in which the force acts. Each force is labelled to indicate the exact type of force.

## 3.4 Newton's Laws of Motion

## Newton's First Law of Motion

It is our common observation that a force is required to move or to stop a body. A book placed on a table remains there unless a force is applied to move it (Fig.3.9). A ball rolling on floor should continue to move with the same velocity in the absence of an applied force. But practically, we see that it is not true. The ball stops after covering some distance. In fact, an opposing force (friction) causes the ball to stop. Newton expressed such observations in his first law of motion which states that:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

A body continues its state of rest orof uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by some external force.

When a fast-moving bus stops suddenly, the passengers tend to bend forward. It is because they want to continue their motion. On the other hand,when the bus This time, the tendency of passengers is to retain their state of rest.

According to first law of motion, a bus moving on the road should continue its motion without any force exerted by the engine. But practically, we see that if the engine stops working, the bus comes to rest after covering some distance. Itis because of the friction between the tyres of the bus and the road. All the bodies moving on the Earth are stopped by the force of friction. lf you were in outer space and throw an object away where no force is acted upon it, the object would continue to move foreverwith constant velocity.

The first law of motion also provides us anotherdefinition of force which is stated as follows:

Force is an agency which changes or tends to change the state of rest or of uniform motion of a body.

In simplewords,wecansaythat forcecauses acceleration.

## Inertia

A net force is required to change the velocity of objects. For instance, a net force may cause a bicycle to pick up speed quickly. But when the same force is applied to a truck, any change in the motion may not be observed. We say that the truck has more inertia than a bicycle. The mass of an object is a measure of its inertia. The greater the mass of an object, the greater is its inertia.

The property of a body tomaintain its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line is called inertia.

As a resultoftheroleof inertia inNewton's first law, this law is sometimes called as law of inertia.

<!-- image -->

## Newton'sSecond Law of Motion

Newton's first law indicates that if no net force acts on an object, then the velocity of the object remains unchanged. The second law deals with the acceleration produced in a body when a net force acts upon it. Newton's second law can be stated as:

If a net external force acts upon a body, it accelerates the body in the direction of force. The magnitude of acceleration is directly proportional to the magnitude of force and is inversely proportional to the mass of the body.

If a net force of magnitude F acts on a body of mass m and produces an as:

$$\begin{matrix} \text {and} & a \ \circ c \ F & \aleph ^ { 0 } \\ & & \aleph ^ { \frac { 1 } { m } } \wr \aleph ^ { 0 } \\ \text {So} & a \ \circ c \frac { F } { m } \wr \diamond \\ \text {or} & a \ \bar { \zeta } ( \text {constant} ) \ \frac { F } { m } \end{matrix}$$

According to Sl units, if m = 1 kg, a = 1 m s², F = 1 N, then the value of the constant will be 1. Therefore, the above equation can be written as:

$$y _ { F } ^ { ( 5 ) } = 1 \times \frac { F } { m } 
 y _ { F } ^ { ( 5 ) } = m a ^ { 2 }$$

First law of motion provides the definition of force, i.e., a force produces an acceleration in a body.By the second law of motion (F = ma), we can calculate mathematically, the amount of force required to produce a certain amount of acceleration in a body of known mass. The Sl unit of force is newton (N).

Onenewton isthe forcewhich produces an acceleration of 1 m s-2 ina body of mass 1 kg.

$$F r o m \, E q \, 3 . 1 \quad \ \ 1 \, N \, = \, 1 \, k g \, m \, s ^ { - 2 }$$

## Effect of Force on Velocity

Newton's second law also tells that a force can change the velocity of a quantity, so the change may be in its magnitude, direction orin both of them.

## Newton's Third Law of Motion

Whenever there is an interaction between two bodies A and B, such that the body A exerts a force on body B, the force is known as action of A on B. In response to this action, the body B exerts a force on the body A. This force is known as reaction of B on A. Forexample,when we press a spring,the force exerted by our hand on the spring is action. Our hand also experiences a force exerted by the spring. This is the force of reaction (Fig.3.10). Newton expressed these action and reaction forces in his third law of motion. It is stated as:

For every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction.

Since, action and reaction do not act on the same body but they act on two different bodies, so they can never balance each other. Thus, Newton's third law can also be expressed as follows:

If one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body also exerts an equal and opposite force on the first body.

## Forces Act in Pairs

We have studied that forces act in pairs when two objects interact, i.e., action and reaction forces.We oftennotice a force that seems to make something happen but usually we do not notice the other force involved. Here are some examples of pairs of forces involved in accordance with Newton's third law of motion.

The force acting downward on the block is the weight. The block exerts a downward force on the table equal to its weight w. The table also exerts a reaction force F,on the block.The two forces on the block balance each other and the block remains at rest.

## 3.5 Limitations of Newton's Laws of Motion

We have already explained that Newton's laws of motion can be applied with very high degree of accuracy to the motion of objects and velocities which we come across in everyday life.

The problems arise when we deal with the motion of elementary particles having velocities close to that of light. For that purpose, relativistic mechanics developed by Albert Einstein is applicable.

After all this discussion, we can say that Newton's laws of motion are not exact for all types of motion, but provide a good approximation, unless an object is small enoughormoving close to the speed oflight.

## 3.6 Mass and Weight

Commonly, we consider mass and weight as the same quantities but scientifically, mass and weight are two different quantities. When we say that the weightof this object is5kg,it is not true.Infact,5 kg is the mass of theobject.The simplest definition of mass is that it is a measure of the quantity of matter in a body.Scientifically,mass of a body can be defined as:

The characteristicof a body which determines the magnitude of acceleration produced when a certain force acts upon it is known as mass of the body.

Mass is a scalar quantity. It remains the same everywhere. Practically, mass is measured by an ordinary balance. The SI unit of mass is kilogram (kg).

Weight is a gravitational force acting on the object. It is a vector quantity directed downward, towards the centre of the Earth.

The weight of an object is equal to the force with which theEarth attracts thebody towardsits centre.

## Gravitational Field

O

experiences a force due to gravitational attraction. The gravitational field on the surface of the Earth exerts a force known as its weight w given by w = m g. where gis the gravitational field strength. Its value is 10 N kg.

As the value of g varies from place to place and also with altitude, therefore, the value of weight does not remain the same everywhere.

It varies from place to place according to variation in g. Though an object's weight may vary from one place to another, but at any particular location, its weight is proportional to its mass. Thus, we can conveniently weights. The weight cannot be measured by an ordinary balance. A spring balance can be used to measure the weight. The SI unit of weight is newton (N).

## Example 3.1

A 10 kg block moves on a frictionless horizontal surface with an acceleration of 2 m s-2. What is the force acting on the block?

## Solution

Mass of a block m =10kg

Acceleration = a = 2ms²

Force = F = ?

ByNewton'ssecond lawof motion, F =ma

Putting thevalues,F = 10kgx2ms²= 20 kgms-2 =20N

## Example 3.2

A force of 7500 N is applied to move a truck of mass 3000 kg. Find the acceleration produced in the truck. How long will it take to accelerate the truck from 36 km h-1 to 72 km h-1 speed?

## Solution

Mass oftruck =m

= 3000kg

Force applied = F =7500N

Acceleration =? D

Initial speed

Final speed

Time t =?

$$= v _ { i } \ = 3 6 k m h ^ { - 1 }$$

$$\frac { 6 0 \times 6 0 \, s } { 2 }$$

$$= \sqrt { v _ { f } } = 7 2 \, k m \, h ^ { - 1 } \ = \frac { 7 2 \times 1 0 0 0 \, m } { 6 0 \, \times \, 6 0 \, s } = 2 0 \, m s ^ { - 1 } 
 \equiv t \ = \ ?$$

By Newton's second law,

$$o r \quad a \, = \frac { F } { m }$$

Putting the values, α = 3000 kg

Now, using first equation of motion,

$$\begin{array} { r l } { v _ { f } = v _ { i } + a t } \\ { o r } & t = \frac { v _ { f } - v _ { i } } { a } } \\ { 2 0 m s ^ { - 1 } = 1 0 } \end{array}$$

20ms-10m sPutting the values,t= =4s 2.5m s2

$$F = m a$$

## 3.7 Mechanical and Electronic Balances

Balance scales are commonly used to compare masses of objects or to weigh objectsby balancing them with standard weights.

## Mechanical Balances

A mechanical balance consists of a rigid horizontal beam that oscillates on a central knife edge as a fulcrum. It has two end knife edges equidistant from the centre. Two pans are hung from bearings on the end knife edges (Fig.3.16). The material to be weighed is put in one pan. Standard weights are put on the other pan. The deflection of the balance may be indicated by a pointer attaches to the beam. The weights on the pan are adjusted to bring the beam in equilibrium.

There is another type of mechanical balances which are used to weigh heavy items like flour bags, cement bags, steel bars, etc. These are called mechanical platform balances (Fig.3.17). Standard weights are not required to use this balance. Its reason is that thefulcrum of thebeam of such a balance is kept very near to its one end. Therefore, much smaller weights have tobe put at the other end of beam to bring it to equilibrium. These smaller weights have already been calibrated to the standard weights.

## Electronic Balances

No standard weights are required to use in an electronic balance (Fig.3.18). Only it has to be connected to a power supply. There are some models which can operate by using dry cell batteries. An electronic balance is more precise than mechanical balance. When an object is placed on it, its mass is displayed on its screen. Now-a-days,

<!-- image -->

electronic balances also display the total price of the material if the rate per kg is fed to the balance.

## Force Meter

A force meter is a scientific instrument that measures force. It is also called as a newton meter or a spring balance (Fig.3.19). Now-a-days digital force meters are also available. You have already learnt about mechanical and electronic balances. They measure mass of the objects in kilograms or its multiples. On the other hand, force meter measures force directly in newtons (N).

An ordinary force meter has a spring inside it. Upper end of the spring is attached to a handle. A hook is attached to the lower end the spring that holds the object. A pointer is also attached to the spring at its upper end. A scale in newtons is provided along the spring such that the pointer coincides with zero of the scale when nothing is hung with the hook.

The object to be weighed is hung with the hook. The mass of the object causes the spring to compress. The pointer indicates the weight of the object. However, some force meters are also based on the stretching of the spring when a load is hung. In this case, the pointer is attached at the lower end of the spring.

In some spring balances, the scale measures the mass which can be readily converted into newtons by multiplying the mass in kg with the value of g = 10ms².

A digital force meter measures directly the weight of the object in newtons (Fig.3.20).

## 3.8 Friction

When a cricket ball is hit by the bat, it moves on the ground with a reasonably large velocity. According to Newton's first law of motion, it should eventually stops after covering some distance. Does any force act on the ball in opposite direction that stops the ball? Yes, it is the force of friction between the ball and the ground that opposes the motion of the ball.

## Dissipative Effect of Friction

Friction is a dissipative force due to which the energy is wasted in doing work to overcome against friction. The lost energy appears in the form of heat.

A very common example of energy dissipation is the rubbing of hands (Fig.3.21). When we rub our hands, heat is produced due to friction and our hands become warm. Similarly, the temperature of machines rises due to friction between its moving parts that can cause many problems. The tyres of vehicles also wear out after becoming too hot due to friction between tyres and road.

Shooting of stars seen in the sky at night also happen due to friction of air. These are actually asteroids that enter the Earth's atmosphere.As they are moving, air resistance causes generation of heat. Their temperature becomes so high that they start burning and ultimately disintegrate.

## Static Friction

Letusconsider the motion ofablock on a horizontal surface. The arrangement is shown in Fig. 3.22. When a weight is put in the pan, a force F = T equal to the sum of this weight and weight of the pan acts on the block. This force tends to pull the block. At the same time an opposing force appears that does not let the block move. This opposing force is the static friction Fs.

## Kinetic Friction

If we go on adding more weights in the pan one by one in small steps, a stage will comewhen the blockstarts sliding on the

horizontal surface. This is the limit of static friction that is equal to the total weights including pan. When the block is sliding, friction still exists. It is known as kinetic friction.

## Do You Know?

When a shuttle re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, the friction caused by the atmosphere raises the surface temperature of the shuttle to over 950°℃.

## Terminal Velocity

When an object falls freely, it is accelerated by an amount g = 10 m s².But role in determining how fast an object accelerates when it falls.

If we drop a cricket ball and a piece of Styrofoam of the same weight from a certain height, they will hit the ground at the same time only if there were no air resistance. Both would fall with the same acceleration g = 10 m s². Practically, the ball in air, would drop faster. The Styrofoam having larger surface would face greater opposing force of the air and thus moves slowly.

Experiments have been made in this respect and it was found that the faster an object falls the more air resistance will be exerted on it. A speed is finally attained atwhich the upward force of air resistance balances the downward force of gravity. When this happens, the object stops accelerating. It keeps falling at a constant

A paratrooper falling with

velocity. This constant velocity achieved by an object is called its terminal velocity. Even a heavy object like a meteorite does not gain an infinite velocity as it falls to the Earth.

This principle applies to paratroopers. Air resistance acting against the large surface area of a parachute allows for descent at a safer velocity (Fig.3.23).

## Rolling Friction

The static and kinetic friction which we have studied so far is the sliding friction. There is another type of friction which is called rolling friction. When an object rolls over a surface, the friction produced is called rolling friction. The idea of rolling friction is associated with the concept of wheel. In our everyday life, we observe that a body with wheels faces less friction as compared to a body of the

<!-- image -->

Ball bearings also play the same role as is played by the wheels. Many machines ball bearing and friction is greatly reduced. The rolling friction is about one hundred times smallerthan the sliding friction.

The reason for the rolling friction to be less than the sliding friction is that there is no relative motion between the wheel and the surface over which it rolls. The wheel touches the surface only at a point. It does not slide.

## Methods to Reduce Friction

The following methods are used to reduce friction:

- () The parts which slide against each other are highly polished.
- (i) Since, the friction of liquids is less than that of solid surfaces, therefore, oil or grease is applied between the moving parts of the machinery.
- (ili) As rolling friction is much less than the sliding friction, so sliding friction is converted into rolling Fig.3.24 friction by the use of ball bearings (Fig. 3.24) in the machines and wheels under the heavy objects.
- (iv) Frictional force does not act only among solids, high speed vehicles, aeroplanes and ships also face friction while moving through air or water. If the front of a vehicle is flat, it faces more resistance by air or water. Therefore, the bodies moving through air or water are streamlined to minimize air or water friction. In this case, the air passes Fig.3.25 Streamline air flow over smoothly over the slanting surface of a speedy car vehicle. This type of flow of air is known as streamline flow.A streamline flow over the car is shown in Fig. 3.25. The vehicles designed pointed from

the front are said to be streamlined.

## 3.9 Momentum and Impulse

Suppose that a bicycle rider and a heavy truck are moving with the same speed, which one can be stopped easily, depends on the quantity of motion of the moving body. It is our common observation that quantity of motion in a moving body depends on its mass and velocity. Greater is the mass, the greater will be the quantity of motion. Similarly, greater is the velocity, the greater will be quantity of motion. This quantity of motion is called momentum and denoted by p. It is defined as:

The momentum of a moving body is the product of its mass and velocity.

$$1 \text { Therefore, } \quad \mathbf p = m \times v \, .$$

Like velocity momentum is also a vector quantity. The Sl unit momentum is (kg m s).It can also be written as (N s).

When a ball is hit by a bat, the force is exerted on the ball for a very short interval of time. In such cases, it is very difficult to calculate the exact magnitude of the force. However, initial velocity v, of the ball and final velocity v, after collision can be found easily.

During a time interval  t, the average acceleration a is given by

$$a = \frac { \Delta v } { \Delta t } \, = \frac { v _ { f } - v _ { i } } { \Delta t } \, \longrightarrow \,$$

According to Newton's second law of motion, the value of average force acting during the interval △twillbe:

$$F = m = m ( \frac { \Delta v } { \Delta t } )$$

$$F \times \Delta t = m ( \Delta v ) = m ( v _ { f } - v _ { i } ) \cdots \cdots \cdots \cdots ( 3 , 4 )$$

$$\begin{array} { r l } & { F = m a = m ( \frac { \Delta v } { \Delta t } ) } \\ & { o r } & { F \times \Delta t = m ( \Delta v ) = m } \end{array}$$

Equation (3.4) shows that F and  t cannot be exactly known but their product which is equal to the change of momentum (mv; - mv) can be calculated.For such cases, the product F x △t is called as Impulse of the force.

When a large force F acts on an object for a short interval of time, the impulse of the force is defined as the total change in momentum of the object.

Dividing both sides of Eq.3.4 by △t, we have

$$F = \frac { m ( \Delta y ) } { 9 \Delta t }$$

where m(△v) is the change in momentum △p. Equation (3.5) gives the value of force in terms of momentum i.e., force acting on an object is equal to the change in momentum of the object per unit time.

$$F = \frac { \Delta p } { \Delta t }$$

Equation (3.6) suggests to define Newton's second law of motion in terms of momentumi.e.,

The rate of change of momentum of a body is equal to the force acting on it.

The direction of change in momentum is that of the force.

## Packing of Fragile Objects

Fragile objects such as glassware may break easily due to jerks or by the direct impact with hard objects during theirtransportation.

To protect them soft, packing materials are used for these objects.These materialsreduce the effect of quick change in momentum. Consequently, the force acting on the fragile objects is greatly reduced. Special materials like Styrofoam, corrugated cardboard sheets, bubble wrap are used for the packing of such objects.

## 3.10 Principle of Conservation of Momentum

The collection of objects is known as a 'system', If no external force acts on any object of the system, it is known as isolated system. Consider a system of two balls of masses m, and m2. Suppose that the balls are moving with velocities v,and v along a straight line in the same direction. If v, &gt; V2, the balls will collide as shown in Fig. 3.26. If their velocities become v,and respectively after collision, then

<!-- image -->

Total momentum of the system before collision = mV, + m2v2

Total momentum of the system after collision =mV+m2V2

The principleof conservationof momentum states that:

Fig.3.26

If no external force actson anisolated system, thefinal total momentum of the system is equal to the initial total momentum of the system.

## This means that:

Total momentum of the system before collision or mV+m2V2

=

=

Total momentum of the system after collision mV1+m2V2

To explain this principle, let us consider the collision of two identical balls in which the second ball is at rest. V1

<!-- image -->

When there is collision of two balls, there is a transfer of momentum from one ball to another. The ball at rest gains momentum and starts moving whereas the striking ball slows down. If the balls are identical, we will observe that there is a total transfer of momentum. The striking ball comes to rest and the other ball starts moving with the same speed (Fig.3. 27). It means that second ball gains momentum equal to that lost by the first one. If the first ball stops after collision, the second ball moves with the momentum of the first ball. This suggests that the total momentum of the two balls after collision remains the same as total momentum before collision.

The principle of conservation of momentum is applicable not only to macro-objects but also for micro-objects like atoms and molecules.

## Example 3.5

<!-- image -->

A bullet of mass m, is fired by a gun of mass m2. Find the velocity of the gun in terms of velocity of bullet v1 just after firing.

## Solution

Before firing, the velocity of bullet as well as that of gun was zero. Therefore, total momentum of bullet and gun was also zero. After firing, the bullet moves forward with velocity v, whereas the gun moves with velocity v2.

According to law of conservation of momentum,

$$\text { according to law of conservation of momentum} , & & \text {Total momentum before firing} \\ & \text {Putting the values, } & & 0 \quad = \quad m _ { 1 } v _ { 1 } \ + \ m _ { 2 } v _ { 2 } \\ & & \text {or} & & v _ { 2 } \ \equiv \ \frac { - m _ { 1 } v _ { 1 } } { m _ { 2 } }$$

$$m _ { 2 }$$

The negative sign in this equation, indicates that the gun moves backward, i.e. opposite to the bullet. It is because of the backward motion of the gun that the shooter gets ajerk on his shoulder.

## Example 3.6

A ball of mass 3 kg moving with a velocity of 5 ms collides with a stationary ball of mass 2 kg and then both ofthem move together. If the friction is negligible, find out the velocity with which both the balls will move after collision.

## Solution

Mass of first ball

=m,=3kg

Velocity of first ball before collision

=v=5ms

Mass of second ball

=m =2kg

Velocity of second ball before collision

=V=0

Velocity of both the balls after collision =v=?

Total mass of balls after collision

=m +m2

- Identify the sources of centripetal force in real life examples [e.g., tension in a string fora stonebeing swirled around, gravity forthe Moon orbiting the Earth]

As we know, a force is a vector quantity, so it acts in a particular direction. We observe various effects of forces. Some forces produce acceleration or decelerating in a body, some tend to turn it around a point and some forces balance each other acting in opposite directions.

All those forces which act parallel to one another are known as parallel forces. The points of application of such forces may be different.

## 4.1 Like and Unlike Parallel Forces

If the parallel forces are acting in the same direction, then they are called like parallel forces and if their directions are opposite to one another, they are called unlike parallel forces. Three forces F, F2 and F, are shown in Fig. 4.1 acting on a rigid body at different points. Here, the forces F, and F, are like parallel forces but F, and F, are unlike parallel forces.

## 4.2 Addition of Forces

In chapter 2, we have learnt about vectors and their representation. Remember that the resultant is the same for any order of addition of vectors. As forces are vectors, so forces can also be added by head-to-tail rule.

To determine the resultant of two or more forces acting in a plane, the following example will explain its method.

## Example 4.1

Let us add three force vectors F, F and F, having magnitudes of 200 N, 300 N and 250 N acting at angles of 30°, 45°, 60° with x-axis. By selecting a suitable scale 100 N = 1 cm, we can draw the force vectors as shown in Fig. 4.2(a). F3

To add these vectors, we apply head-to-tail rule as shown in Fig. 4.2(b).

Measured length of resultant force is 7.1 cm.According to selected scale, magnitude of the resultant force F is 710 N and direction is at an angle 43°withx-axis.

## 4.3 Turning Effect of a Force

We have learnt so far that a net force affects the liner motion of an object by causing it to accelerate. Since rigid objects can also rotate, so we need to extend our concept to the turning effect of a force. When we open or close a door, we apply force. This force rotates the door about its hinge. This is called turning effect of force. Similarly, we use turning effect of force when we open or close a water tap. Let us define some terms used in the study of turning effect of a force.

If the distance between two points of the body remains the same under the action of a force, it is called a rigid body. Axisofrotation

During rotation, all the particles of the rigid body rotate along fixed circles as shown in Fig. 4.3. The straight line joining the centres of these circles is called the axis of rotation. In this case, it is OZ. To observe the turning effect of a force, let us perform an activity.

## Activity 4.1

Take your class to play ground where a see-saw is available. Let a lighter child sits on the leftside and the heavier one on the right side of the see-saw.The distances of

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

both the children from the pivot should be equal. The force exerted by each child is equal to his weight acting downward.Does the heavier child move down? Yes, because he is exerting larger force. Now move the heavier child nearer to the pivot and the lighter child away from the pivot as shown in the figure. Ask the students what do they observe?

You will see that the see-saw tilts to the opposite direction and the lighter child moves down. This shows that the turning effect of a force does not depend only on its magnitude but also on the location where it acts. Therefore, we can say that the greater the force, the greater is its turning effect. Moreover, the larger the perpendicular distance of the force from the axis of rotation, the greater is its turning effect.

The line along which the force acts is called the line of action of the force.

The perpendicular distance of the line of action of a force from the axis of rotation is known as moment arm of the force or simply moment arm.

The moment arms of both the children are shown in the figure of activity 4.1. There are many other examples to observe the turning or rotational effect of a force. It is harder to open a door by pushing it at a point closer to the

handles are always installed at larger distances from hinges to the doors be opened or closed more easier. Similarly, it requires greater force to open a nut by a spanner if you hold it closer such as pointA than point B (Fig. 4.5).

<!-- image -->

## Moment of Force

The turning effect of a force is measured by a quantity known as moment of force or torque.

Moment of a force or torque is defined as the product of the force and the moment arm.

The magnitude of torque is given by

$$\tau = F \times \ell$$

Where t (tau) is the torque and  is the moment arm. In Fig. 4.6, the line of action of a force F is perpendicular to r, therefore, moment arm  = r. Remember

<!-- image -->

Fig.4.4

<!-- image -->

## Do You Know?

Moment of force is applicable in the working of bottle opener. A small force applied at longer moment arm produces more torque while opening a bottle.

<!-- image -->

that the torque of a force is zero when the line of action of a force passes through the axis of rotation, because its moment arm becomes zero. The torque is positive if the force tends to produce an anticlockwise rotation about the axis, and it is taken as negative if the force tends to produce a clockwise rotation. The Sl unit of torque is newton metre (N m).

In many cases, the line joining the axis of rotation and point P where the force F acts, is not perpendicular to the force F. Therefore, Op will not be the moment arm for F. In such cases, we have to find a component of force F perpendiculars to OP =  (Fig. 4.7), or we can find r the component of &amp; that is perpendicular to the (line of action) force F(Fig. 4.8).

<!-- image -->

Fig.4.7

<!-- image -->

For this, we need to know the method of finding rectangular components of a force or any vector. This is also called as resolution of Forces.

## Couple

A couple is a special type of torque. We observe at many situations in our example, while opening or closing a water tap, turning key in the lock, opening the lid of a jar and turning steering wheel of a motor car, we apply a pair of equal forces in opposite directions. The torque produced in this way in known as couple.

<!-- image -->

When two equal and opposite parallel forces act at two different points of the same body, they form a couple.

## Steering wheel of vehicles

While turning a vehicle, a couple is applied on the steering wheel. It is interesting to know that now-a-days, steering wheels of smaller diameter are installed in vehicles.Thereason is that,most of the vehicles are provided with power steering in which a pump pushes hydraulic fluid to reduce the force needed toturn the wheels,resultingineffortlesssteering.

## Example 4.2

A spanner 25 cm long isused toopen a nut. If a force of 400 N is applied at the end of a spanner shown in Fig.4.10, what is the torque acting on the nut?

## Solution

## 4.4 Resolution of Vectors

By head-to-tail rule, two or more vectors can be added to give a resultant vector, Its reverse process is also possible, i.e., a given vector can be divided into two or more parts. These parts are called as components of the given vector. If these components are added up, their resultant is equal to the given vector. To divide a force into its components is known as resolution of a force.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Usually, a force is resolved into two components which are perpendicular to each other. These are called its perpendicular or rectangular components oftheforce.

Let us resolve a force F into its perpendicular components. A force F acting on a body at an angle 0 with x-axis is shown in Fig. 4.11(a). Imagine a beam of light is placed above the vector F. As the light falls perpendicularly to the x-axis, it will cast a shadow OAof vector Fontox-axis. Wecall this shadow as x-component of vector F. In the same way, if light is thrown perpendicular to y-axis, the shadow OB of vector F on y-axis is the y-componentof F.

A component of a vector is its effective value in a given direction.

<!-- image -->

The x and y components can be practically drawn simply by dropping x-component of force F is denoted as Fandy-component as Fy

From Fig. 4.11(b), it is evident that F is the resultant vector of components Fand F, Moreover, Fand F, are perpendicular to each other. Therefore, Fand F, are called perpendicular components of vector F.

The magnitudes of the perpendicular components can be found from the right angled triangle OAC in Fig. 4.11(b). Do You Know?

## Trigonometric Ratios

Trigonometric is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties of a right angled triangle. A right angled triangle ABC is shown in the figure.Angle A is denoted by θ (theta) called the angle of the right angled triangle.The sideAB iscalled thebase,the side BCis called the perpendicular and the side AC is called as hypotenuse. The ratio of any two sides is given the names asbelow:

$$\frac { \text {The ratio of any two sides is given the names as} } { \text {Hypotenuse} } & = \frac { \text {BC} } { \text {AC} } = \text { sine } \theta \\ \frac { \text {Base} } { \text {Hypotenuse} } & = \frac { \text {AB} } { \text {AC} } = \cos \theta \\ \frac { \text {Perpendicular} } { \text {Base} } & = \frac { \text {BC} } { \text {AB} } = \tan g \theta \\ \text {For simplicity, sine $\theta$, cosine $\theta$ and tan}$$

For simplicity, sine θ, cosine θ and tangent θ are written as sin θ, cos 0 and tan θ respectively. Values of these ratios for some frequently used angles are given in the table.

## 4.5 Determination of a Force from its Prependicular Components

The magnitude and direction of a force can be found if its perpendicular triangle OAC (Fig. 4.11-b).

$$0 \widehat { O } _ { F ^ { 2 } } = \widehat { F } _ { x } ^ { 2 } + \widehat { F } _ { y } ^ { 2 } 
 \sqrt { 2 } F = \sqrt { F _ { x } ^ { 2 } + F _ { y } ^ { 2 } }$$

Hence, using Eq. (4.4) the magnitude F of the required vector F can be determined. The direction of F is given by

$$1 . \, \text {The addition of } 8 F _ { x } \colon \text {is given by} \\ \tan \theta = \frac { F _ { x } } { F _ { x } } \dots \dots ( 4 . 5 ) \\ \text {or} \quad \theta = \tan ^ { - 1 } ( \frac { F _ { x } } { F _ { x } } ) \\$$

By using table of trigonometric ratios or calculator, the value of θ can be determined.

## Example 4.3

A force of 160 N is acting on a wooden box at an angle of 60° with the horizontal direction. Determine the values of its x and y components.

## Solution

Magnitude of force F=160N

$$\ A n g l e & & \theta = 6 0 ^ { \circ }$$

Using calculator, sin θ = sin 60° = 0.866

$$\cos \theta \, = \cos 6 0 ^ { \circ } = 0 . 5$$

x-component is given by Eq. (4.2)

$$F _ { x } = F \cos \theta$$

Putting the values, F = 160 N x0.5 = 80 N

y-component is given by Eq.(4.3)

$$F _ { y } = F \sin \theta \\ F _ { y } = F \sin \alpha$$

Putting the values, F,=160N ×0.866= 138.6N

## 4.6 Principle of Moments

To understand the principle of moments, let us perform an activity.

## Activity4.2

Balance a metre rule on a wedge at its centre of gravity such that the metre rule stays horizontal. Suspend two weights w, and w, on one side of the metre rule at distance and &amp; from the centre and a third weight w,on the other side at distance until the rule is again balanced.

<!-- image -->

The weights w, and w, tend to rotate the rod anticlockwise about CG and the weight w, tends to rotate it clockwise.The values of the moments of the weights are W,x ,w,x and w,x &amp;.When the metre rule isbalanced, then

Total anticlockwise moments = Total clockwise moments

$$w _ { 1 } \times \ell + w _ { 2 } \ell _ { 2 } = w _ { 3 } \times \ell _ { 3 }$$

This is known as principle of moments, which is stated as:

When a body is in balanced position, the sum of clockwise moments about any point equals the sum of anticlockwise moments about that point.

## Example 4.4

A metre stick is pinned at its one end O on a table so that it can rotate freely. One force of magnitude 18 N is applied perpendicular to the length of the stick at its free end. Another force of magnitude 60N is acting at an angle of 30° with the stick as shown in Fig. 4.13(a). At what distance AN 09 from the end of stick that is pinned should the second T30° force act such that the stick does not rotate? → 1.0 m

## Solution

<!-- image -->

Weight of the stick does not affect in the horizontal plane. Resolving force F of magnitude = 60 N into rectangular components that act at distance dfrom point O: 60N

$$\begin{array} { r l r } { A i n S i n P o n E \colon } \\ { F _ { x } = 6 0 N \times \cos \ 3 0 ^ { \circ } = 6 0 N \times 0 . 8 6 6 = 5 1 . 9 6 N } \\ { F _ { y } = 6 0 N \times \sin 3 0 ^ { \circ } = 6 0 N \times 0 . 5 } & = 3 0 N } \\ { A s t h e c o m p o n e n F a n s s h o w h e r a y \stackrel { \leftarrow } { \leftarrow } } \end{array}$$

As the component F, passes through the axis d'=1.0m of rotation, its torque is zero. Torque T, of 30 N is 18N Fig 4.13(b) positive and t, of 18 N force is negative. The stick will not rotate when these two torques balance each others, i.e t=tor F,xd=F'xd"

$$a c h i n o l l e s , 1 . 1 e ^ { t _ { 1 } = 1 2 } d _ { 2 } P _ { y } x ^ { 2 } d = 3 0 N 
 d = ( \frac { 1 8 N \times 1 m } { 3 0 N } ) = 
 x = 0 0 0$$

## 4.7 Centre of Gravity and Centre of Mass

An objectis composed ofa largenumberof small particles.Each particle is acted upon by the gravitational force directed towards the centre of the Earth (Fig. 4.14-a). As the object is small as compared to the Earth, the value of g can be taken as uniform over all particles. Therefore, each particle experiences the same force mg. Since all these forces are parallel and act in the same direction, so their resultant as shown in Fig. 4.14(b) willbe equal to the sum of all these forces.i.e,

Resultant force = mg where means the "sum of".

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

We know that the sum of the gravitational forces acting on all particles is equal to the total weight of the object w = Mg Where M=m=massofthe object.

Centre of gravity is that point where total weight of the body appears to be acting.

If a body is supported at its centre of gravity, it stays there without centre. Centre of gravityof some geometrical shapes is given in Table 4.1.

|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Object            | Centre of Gravity                      |
| Square, Rectangle | Point of intersection of the diagonals |
| Triangle          | Point of intersection of the medians   |
| Round plate       | Centre of the plate                    |
| Sphere            | Centre of the sphere                   |
| Cylinder          | Centre of the axis                     |

## Centre of Gravity of a Plane Lamina

For an irregular shaped plane lamina, the centre of gravity can be found by suspending it freely through different points (Fig. 4.15-a). Each time the object is suspended, its centre of gravity lies on the vertical line drawn from the point of suspension with the help of a plumb line. The exact position of the centre of gravity is at the point where two such lines cross each other as shown in Fig 4.15(b). The centre of gravity can exist inside a body or outside the body as is in case of a cup.

## Centre of Mass

<!-- image -->

Newton's second law of motion is applicable to single particle or system of particles. Even when the parts of a system have different velocities and acceleration, there is still one point in the system whose acceleration could be found by applying second law. This point is called the centre of mass of the system.

<!-- image -->

The centre of mass of a body is that point where the whole mass of the body is assumed to be concentrated.

Hence, the centre of mass behaves as if all the mass ofthe body or system frictionless floor. There is no resultant force on the wrench. Therefore, its centre of mass, shown by a yellow dot, follows a linear path with constant speed.

Fig. 4.16: Rotating wrench sliding along a frictionless floor

<!-- image -->

On the surface of the Earth, where g is almost uniform, the centre of mass of an object coincides with its centre of gravity.

## 4.8 Equilibrium

We have learnt how translatory and rotational motion can be caused due to the application of external forces. Now, we shall see how external forces can be balanced to produce no translational or Do You Know? rotational effects.

We know that if a number of forces act on a body such that their resultant is zero, the body remains at rest or continues to move with uniform velocity if already in motion. This state of the body is known as equilibrium, which can be stated as:

This is a fascinating scene ofequilibrium.

<!-- image -->

## A body is said to be in equilibrium if it has no acceleration.

There are two types of equilibrium:

- (i) Static equilibrium (ii) Dynamic equilibrium

A body at rest is in static equilibrium whereas a body moving with uniform velocity is in dynamic equilibrium.

An example of static equilibrium is a book lying on the table as shown in Fig. 4.17. Only two forces are acting on it. One is its weight w = mg acting

downward and theotherisF,thenormal force thatthe table exerts upward on the book. Since the book is at rest so, it has zero acceleration.Therefore, the sum of all the forces acting on the book should be zero, so that the book is said to be in equilibrium. Hence

$$\begin{matrix} & F _ { n } - w = 0 \\ \text {or} & F _ { n } = w \end{matrix}$$

Fig.4.17 Book is in static equilibrium

This means that forces can act on a body without accelerating it, provided these forces balance each other.

An electric bulb hanging from the ceiling of a room, a man holding a box, a beam held horizontal against a wall with the help of a rope and a hanging weight (Fig. 4.18), are all examples of static equilibrium.

A good example of dynamic equilibrium is a paratrooper (Fig. 4.19). In a few second after the free fall, the parachute opens and a little later, the paratrooper starts descending with a uniform velocity. In this state, the force of gravity acting vertically downward on the paratrooper is balanced by the resistance of air on the parachute acting upward.

## 4.9 Conditions of Equilibrium

There are two conditions of equilibrium:

## First Condition of Equilibrium

By Newton's second law of motion, F = ma If the body is in translational equilibrium, then a = 0, therefore, netforce F should be0 or F=0....(4.7)

This is the mathematical form of the first condition of equilibrium which states that:

<!-- image -->

A body is said to be in translational equilibrium only if the vector sum of all the external forces acting on it is equal to zero.

In case a number of coplanar forces F, F2, F . having their resultant equal to F, are acting on a body, these can be resolved into their rectangular

downward and theotherisF,thenormal force thatthe table exerts upward on the book. Since the book is at rest so, it has zero acceleration.Therefore, the sum of all the forces acting on the book should be zero, so that the book is said to be in equilibrium. Hence

$$\begin{matrix} & F _ { n } - w = 0 \\ \text {or} & F _ { n } = w \end{matrix}$$

Similarly, alongy-direction, or

$$F _ { 1 y } + F _ { 2 y } + F _ { 3 y } + \dots = 0 \\ \sum F _ { y } = 0 \quad \dots ( 4 . 9 ) \\ \intertext { t r e s t d i o n i o n o f a u l i b r i u m c a n a l o s b a t a t d e r a s }$$

Thus, first condition of equilibrium can also be stated as:

The sum of all the components of forces along x-axis should be zero and the sum of all the components of forces along y-axis should also be zero.

## Second Condition of Equilibrium

The second condition of equilibrium implies to the rotational equilibrium which means that the body should not rotate under the action of the forces.

Consider the example of a rigid body in Fig.4.20. Two forces F, and Fof equal magnitude are acting on it. In case (a), both the forces act along the same line of action.

In case (b), the lines of action of the two forces are different. Since magnitude of F, and F are equal, so the resultant force is zero in both the cases. Thus, first condition of equilibrium is satisfied. But you can observe that in case (b), the forces are forming a couple which can apply torque to rotate the body about point O. Therefore, for a body to be completely in equilibrium, a second second condition of equilibrium which can be stated as:

The vector sum of all the torques acting on a body about any point must be zero.

## Solving Problems by Applying Conditions of Equilibrium

The following steps will help to solve problems by applying conditions of equilibrium.

1. First of all, select the objects to which Eqs. (4.8) and (4.9) are to be applied. Each object should be treated separately.
2. Draw a diagram to show the objects and forces acting on them. Only the forces acting on the objects should be included. The forces
3. which the objects exert on their environment should not be included.
3. Choose a set of x, y axes such that as many forces as possible lie directly along x-axis ory-axis, it will minimize the number of forces to be resolved into components.
4. Resolve all the forces which are not parallel to either of the axes, in their rectangularcomponents.
5. Apply Eqs. (4.8) and (4.9) by putting ∑ F. = 0 and  F, = 0 to get two equations.
7. 6.
7. The equations can be solved simultaneous to find out desired unknown quantities.

## Example4.5

A picture is suspended by means of two vertical strings as shown in Fig 4.21. The weight of the picture is 5 N, and it is acting at its centre of gravity. Find the tension T, &amp; T, in the two strings.

## Solution

Total upward force = T, + T2

Total downward force =w =5N

Tensions in the strings, T,=? and T = ?

Since, there is no horizontal force,so F= 0

Already

∑F.=0

Putting

∑F,=0

T,+T2-W=0

Apply T = 0, selecting point B as point of rotation. Here, torque T,of T, is

negative whereas torque 2 of w is positive about point B. T2 produces zero torque as it passes through the point of rotation. Hence,

## 4.10 States of Equilibrium

<!-- image -->

An object is balanced when its centre of mass and its point of support lie on the same vertical line. Then forces on each side are balanced, and the object is said to be in equilibrium. There are three states of equilibrium in connection with stability of the balanced bodies.

## Stable Equilibrium

A body is said to be in a state of stable equilibrium, if after a slight tilt, it comes back to its original position.

Stable equilibrium occurs when the torques arising from the rotation (tilt) of the object compel the body back towards its equilibrium position.

The cone shown in Fig 4.22(a) is in the state of stable equilibrium. Its weight w acting downward at the centre of gravity G and the reaction of the floor F, acting upward, lie on the same vertical line. Since these forces are equal and in opposite direction, so they balance each other and both the conditions of equilibrium are satisfied.

<!-- image -->

As you try to push over the cone slightly, its centre of gravity is raised but it still remains above the base of the cone. The weight w and the normal force F, do not remain in the same line but act like two unlike parallel forces. The cone does not remain in equilibrium. Unlike parallel forces produce a clockwise torque which brings the cone back to its original position.It is worth noting that the body remains in equilibrium as long its centre of mass lies within the base.

## Unstable Equilibrium

Try to balance the cone on its tip. It is balanced for a moment because w and F, lie along the same line. Even it is slightly tilted, it will not come back to its original position by itself. Rather it will fall downward, because its centre of mass no longer remains above the base.It topples over, because line of action of w no longer lies inside the base O (Fig. 4.23). In this case, centre of gravity is lowered on tilting and continues to fall further. It cannot rise up a again because the anticlockwise torque produced by w moves it further downward.

<!-- image -->

A body is said to be in a state of unstable equilibrium, if after a slight tilt, it tends to move on further away from its original position.

## Neutral Equilibrium

A cylinder resting on a horizontal surface (Fig. 4.24) shows the neutral equilibrium. If the cylinder is rotated slightly, there is no force or torque that

<!-- image -->

↑F. brings it back to its original position or moves it away. As the cylinder rotates, the height of the centre of mass remains G unchanged. In any position of the cylinder, its weight and reaction of the ground lie in the same vertical line. ↓w Fig.4.24

A body is in neutral equilibrium, if it comes to rest in its new position after disturbance without any change in its centre of mass.

Other examples of neutral equilibrium are a ball rolling on a horizontal surfaces, or a cone resting on its curved surface (Fig.4.25).

## 4.11 Improvement of Stability

Fig.4.25

<!-- image -->

It is our daily life observation that a low armchair is more stable than a high chair because of its low centre of gravity. The position of centre of gravity is very important when we are talking about stability. A bus can be stable or unstable depending on how it is loaded. lf the heavy loads are placed on the floor of the bus, its centre of gravity will be low. Now if it is disturbed slightly, a torque will bring it back to its original position.

## Interesting Information!

A double decker bus is being tilting to test its stability.

<!-- image -->

In this case, the bus is in stable equilibrium. If the same bus is loaded with steel sheets on the top, the centre of gravity be raised. It is now near to a state of unstable equilibrium.A couple will turn it over if it is slightlytilted.The same is the case of ships and boats. We can improve the stability of a system either by lowering the centre of gravity or by widening the base.

## Interesting Information!

An unstable equilibrium is illustrated in this figure.A chair in normal position is quite stable (Fig. a) but it has been turned into an unstable position by tilting it back on its legs (Fig. b). In this tilted position, a couple is formed by itsweight w and reaction F,of the ground. This clockwise couple tends to overturn chairbackward.

<!-- image -->

## 4.12 Application of Stability in Real Life

The concept of stability is widely applied to engineering technology especially in manufacturing racing cars and balancing toys.

As the racing cars are driven at very high speeds and also there are sharp turns in the track, therefore, the chances of the cars to topple over increase. To possible. There base areas are also increased by keeping the wheel outside of their main bodies.Balancing toys are alsovery interesting for both children and elders. Look at some balancing toys shown belows.

The physics behind these types of toys is that stability is built in with any direction, the centre of gravity is raised and it becomes unstable for a moment. It comes back to its initial stable position by lowering its centre of gravity.

## Rotational Motion Versus Translatinal Motion

Counterparts of velocity, acceleration, force and momentum in translational motion are angular velocity, angular acceleration, moment of force (torque) and angular momentum respectively in rotational motion. It suggests that the torque plays the same role in the rotational motion that is played by the force in the translational motion. Therefore, we are justified to predict that analogous to Newton's first law of motion, a rotating object will continue to do (torque). However, if a resultant torque is applied to rotating object, it will accelerate depending on the direction of the torque relative to the axis of rotation.

This fundamental principle enhances our understanding how objects move and interact with their environment whether in linear or rotational motion scenarios. e

## Motion in a Circle

When a body is moving along a circular path, its velocity at any point is directed along the tangent drawn atthat point.Figure 4.28 shows that the direction of tangent at each point on a circle is different, therefore, the velocity of an object moving with uniform speed in a circle is changing constantly. Hence, a force perpendicular to the direction of motion is always

<!-- image -->

required to keep the object moving with uniform speed in a circular path.

It should be noted that F is essentially perpendicular to v. For an instance, if it is not perpendicular tov, the force F willhave a component in the direction of v. This will change the magnitude of velocity. As the body moves with constant speed, so it is possible only if the componentof force along vis F cos 90° = 0.

## 4.13 Centripetal Force

We have studied above that an object can move in a circular path with it. This force is always directed towards the centre of the circle. It is called centripetal force and can be defined as:

The force that causes an object to move in a circle at constant speed is called the centripetal force.

For an object of mass m moving with uniform speed v in circle of radius r, the magnitude of centripetal force F, acting on it can be calculated by using the relation:

$$F _ { c } = \frac { m V } { r }$$

$$\underline { m v ^ { 2 } }$$

## Example 4.5

A 150 g stone attached to a string is whirled in a horizontal circle at a force acting on the stone. Neglect effects of gravity.

## Solution

Mass of stone =m=150g=0.15kg Speed ofstone =v = 8ms Radius of circle = r= 1.2m Centripetal force = F=?

Using Eq.4.11,

Putting the values,

$$F _ { c } = \frac { m v ^ { 2 } } { r } \\ F _ { c } = \frac { 0 . 1 5 \, k g \times ( 8 \, m \, s ^ { 1 } ) ^ { 2 } } { 1 . 2 \, m } \ = 8 \, N$$

## Sources of Centripetal Force

We have learnt that centripetal force has to be supplied if the body is to be maintained in its circular path.What could be the sources of centripetal force?

A stone whirled in a circle by a string

<!-- image -->

If we tie a stone to one end of a string and whirl it from the other end, we will have to exert a force on the stone through the string (Fig4.29-a). If we release the string when it is at any point P, the stone will fly off along the tangent (PQ) to the circle. Then, it will move along the same straight linewith constant velocity unless an unbalanced force acts upon it.

In fact, the tension T in the string was providing the stone the necessary centripetal force to keep it along the circular path (Fig 4.29-b). When we release the string we stop applying force on the stone and hence it moves in a straight line.

Now consider the case of the moon which moves around the Earth at constant speed. The gravity of the Earth provides the necessary centripetal force to keep it in its orbit. Same is the case of satellites orbiting the Earth in circular paths with uniform speed. The gravitational pull of the Earth provides centripetal force.

One of the real life examples is a washing machine dryer. A dryer is a metallic cylinderical drum with many small holes in its walls. Wet clothes s      d friction between clothes and drum walls provides necessary centripetal force. As the water molecules are free to move, so they cannot get the required centripetal force to move in circular paths and escape from the drum through the holes. This results into quick drying of clothes.

Another interesting example is that of a cream separator. In a cream separator, milk is whirled rapidly.

<!-- image -->

Fig. 4.29 (b)

<!-- image -->

Fig. 4.30 A satellite orbiting the Earth

Fig. 4.31 Washing machine

<!-- image -->

Fig.4.32

<!-- image -->

The lighter particles of cream experience less centripetal force and gather in the central part of the machine. The heavier particles of milk need greater centripetal force to keep their circular motion in circles of small radius r. In this way, they move awaytowards thewalls.

Work and energy are important concepts in physics as well as in our everyday life. Commonly the word 'work' covers all sort of activities whether mental or physical. If a girl is studying (Fig. 5.1) or a man is standing (Fig. 5.2) with a load of bricks on his head, we say that they are doing work. But according to physics, work has a specific definition. Work is said to be done when a force acts on an object and moves it through some distance.

<!-- image -->

The concept of energy is closely associated with that of work, when work is done by one system on another, energy is transferred between the two systems.

In this chapter, we will define work, energy, power and efficiency and show how they are related to one another.

## 5.1 Work

Fig.5.1

Fig.5.2

<!-- image -->

Force and distance are two essential elements of work. When a constant force work'.

Work is defined as the product of magnitude of force and the distance covered in the direction of force.

Consider a block of wood lying on a table (Fig. 5.3). If we exert a force F on the block to move it through a distance S in the direction of force, then the work W done by the force is:

$$\begin{matrix} \text {Work} = \text {Magnitude of force} \times \text {Distance} \\ o r \quad W = F \times S \quad \text { ...(5.1)} \end{matrix}$$

<!-- image -->

From Eq. (5.1), it can be concluded that if some force is acting on a body but there is no displacement, then no work is done. For example, a man is pushing hard a wall but the wall remains fixed in its place. In this case, the man is doing no work(Fig. 5.4).

Similarly, if a force acting on the body is zero and the body is moving with uniform velocity, work will be zero.

$$\ A s F = 0 \quad \text {so} \quad W = 0 \times S = 0$$

## 5.1 Work

Force and distance are two essential elements of work. When a constant force work'.

Work is defined as the product of magnitude of force and the distance covered in the direction of force.

Consider a block of wood lying on a table (Fig. 5.3). If we exert a force F on the block to move it through a distance S in the direction of force, then the work W done by the force is:

$$\begin{matrix} \text {Work} = \text {Magnitude of force} \times \text {Distance} \\ o r \quad W = F \times S \quad \text { ...(5.1)} \end{matrix}$$

<!-- image -->

From Eq. (5.1), it can be concluded that if some force is acting on a body but there is no displacement, then no work is done. For example, a man is pushing hard a wall but the wall remains fixed in its place. In this case, the man is doing no work(Fig. 5.4).

Similarly, if a force acting on the body is zero and the body is moving with uniform velocity, work will be zero.

$$\ A s F = 0 \quad \text {so} \quad W = 0 \times S = 0$$

Fig.5.4

<!-- image -->

What will be the work done when a force is acting on a body making an angle θ with the direction of motion? In this case, work is done due to the component of force which is acting along the direction of motion (Fig.5.5).

Resolving the force Finto its components, we have the component F cosθ thatacts in the direction of motion.Therefore,

$$W = ( F \cos \theta ) \, S \\ \text {or} \quad W = F S \cos \theta \, \dots \, ( 5 . 2 )$$

Ifθ is zero, cos 0° = 1, then

$$W = F S \left ( 1 \right ) = F S$$

This is the case when force and distance covered are in the same direction.Now if θ = 90°, then cos 90°=0 which means the force has zero component in the direction of motion. Thus,

$$W = F S \left ( 0 \right ) = 0$$

This is the case when force is perpendicular to the displacement. Look at Fig. 5.6, it suggests that if a person carries a bag to some distance, this work is zero, because the force applied to hold the load is upward which is perpendicular to the displacement.

Fig.5.6

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The work done to push an object is the same whether the object moves north to south or east to west, provided the magnitude of force and the distance moved are not changed. Work does not convey any directional information, so it is a scalar quantity.

## Calculation of Work Done by Graph

When a constant force Facts through a distance S, the event can be plotted on a force-distance graph as shown in Fig. 5.7. if the force and distance covered are in the same direction, the work done is F x S.

Clearly the shaded area in the figure is also F x S. Hence, the area under a force-distance curve can be taken to represent the work done by that force.

<!-- image -->

## Units of Work

The Sl unit of work is joule (J).

One joule work is done when a force of one newton acting on a body moves it through a distance of one metre in its own direction.

$$\text {From Eq. (5.1)} & & 1 J = 1 N \times 1 m \\ & & \text {or} \quad 1 J = N m \\ \text {Eigenunits are also used like} & &$$

Bigger units are also used like 1kJ=10²J and 1MJ = 10°J

## Example 5.1

Aperson does 200 J of work in pushinga carton through a distance of 5 metres. How much force is applied by him?

## Solution

$$\begin{array} { r l } { \text {Solution} } & W = 2 0 J } \\ { \text {Work done} } & \Delta = 5 m } \\ { \text {Force} } & F = ? } \\ { \text {From Eq. (5.1)} } & W = F x S ( F = \frac { W } { S } ) } \\ { \text {Putting the values, we get } } & F = \frac { 2 0 J } { 5 m O } \sqrt { 4 0 N } } \\ { \text {Example 5.2} } & \sqrt { 5 } \sqrt { 3 } } \end{array}$$

## 5.2 Energy

Our body cannot move unless we have energy from food. A car would not run without the energy it obtains from burning fuel. Machines in the factories cannot run without consuming energy supplied by we say that a certain body has energy, we mean that it has the ability of doing work.

## Energy can be defined as the ability of a body to do work.

When someone does work, energy of the body has to be spent. In fact, energy is transferred to the body on which work is done. In other words, the energy is transferred from one system to another. For example,

<!-- image -->

when you do work pushing a swing, chemical energy in your body is transferred

Like work, energy is a scalar quantity. Its SI unit isjoule (J).

When onejoule work is done on a body,the amount of energy spent is one joule.

study later on. There are two basic forms of energy:

- (i) Kinetic energy
- (ii) Potential energy-

e

## Kinetic Energy

The kinetic energy of a body is the energy that a body possesses by virtue of its motion.

force can be applied on the body to stop its motion, Then the work done by the force will be equal to the kinetic energy of the body.i.e., Kinetic energy (E) =Workdone(W)

on the body through a distance S brings it to rest. Then,

$$E _ { k } = W r k d o n e = F \times S \\ \text {As } F = m a \text { and } S = v _ { a v } \times \text {time} = & ( \frac { v + 0 } { 2 } ) t = \frac { v } { 2 } \times t \\ \text {Hence} , E _ { k } = m a \times \frac { v t } { 2 } = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \ m a \times v t \\$$

Using velocity-time graph (Fig 5.9), the acceleration 'a' is given by its slope.

Hence, α = V direction.

$$\text {Thus} \quad E _ { k } = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \, m \, \left ( \frac { v } { t } \right ) v t \\ \text {or} \quad E _ { k } = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \, m v ^ { 2 }$$

$$E _ { k } = \frac { 1 } { 2 } m v ^ { 2 } \quad \longrightarrow \, ( 5 . 3 )$$

## Example5.3

- The energy output of a power station in one year is 1016J.

A truck of mass 30o0 kg is moving on a road with uniform single beat of human velocity of 54 km h-1. Determine its kinetic energy.

## Solution

Mass ofthe truck m = 3000 kg

Velocity v= 54 km h-1=15 ms-1

Kinetic energy E = ?

Putting the values,

$$= \frac { 1 } { 2 } \times 3 0 0 0 \dot { k g } \times ( 1 5 ) ^ { 2 } \, m ^ { 2 } \, s ^ { - 2 }$$

$$E _ { k } = 3 3 7 5 0 0 \, J = 3 3 7 . 5 k J ^ { 2 }$$

## Potential Energy

In the previous section, we have seen that the work done on a body is used to increase its kinetic energy. Sometimes, the work done on a body does not

Potential energy is defined as the energy that a body possesses by virtue of its position or deformation.

## Forms of Potential Energy

There are many forms of potential energy. As mentioned above, the energy possessed by an object by virtue of its position relative to the Earth is known as gravitational potential energy.

## Do You Know?

<!-- image -->

The energy stored in a compressed or stretched spring is called elastic potential energy and the potential energy in the chemicals of a battery is called reactions. Thermal or internal energy is released by burning fossil fuels i.e. coal, oil or gas through chemical reactions.

Nuclear energy is the hidden energy in the nuclei of atoms. When they are broken, energy is released in the form of heat and some other radiations. This is called nuclear fission.

If the block shown in Fig. 5.10 is lifted to a height h above the ground,then the block would have potential energy in that raised position. Therefore, it has the ability to do work whenever it is allowed to fall. How should potential energy be measured? Because work is done on the block to put it into the position where it has potential energy. potential energy E, is given by

<!-- image -->

E, =Work done to put the blockin elevated position

The applied force necessary to lift the block with constant velocity is equal to weight w of the block and since w = mg, therefore, potential energy of the block at height h becomes,

<!-- image -->

The most obvious example of gravitational potential energy is a waterfall (Fig. 5.11), water at the top of the fall has potential energy. When the water falls to the bottom, it can be used to run turbines to produce electricity and thus can do work.

$$\begin{matrix} & & E _ { p } = w h \\ & & \text {or} & E _ { p } = m g h \\ & & & \text {The $o$-max} \end{matrix} \underbrace { ( 5 . 4 ) ^ { \sim } }$$

## Example5.4

A ball of mass 180 g was thrown vertically upward to a height of 12 m. Find the potential energy gained by the ball.

## Solution

Mass of ball m = 180 g = 0.18 kg Height h=12m

## ForYourInformation!

According to Einstein's theory of relativity, matter and energy are interchangeable under certain conditions. The loss of some mass in nuclear reactions may transform into energy production and similarly energy may be converted into material particles. Hence, now we have conservation of mass and energy rather that conservation of each separately.

E,=0.18kg×10ms²×12m= 21.6J

## 5.3 Conservation of Energy

The study of various forms of energy and the transformation of one kind of energy into another has led to a very important principle known as the principle of conservation ofenergy. Formally, it is stated as:

Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It may be transformed from one form to another, but the total amount of energy never changes.

During energy transfer process, some energy seems to be lost and not accounted for in calculations. This loss of energy is due to work done against friction of the moving parts in the process. This energy appears as heat and is some useful work and may be called waste energy.

A process of energy conversion and conservation can be described with the given example. O

Let a body of mass m be at rest at a point A above the height h from the ground (Fig.5.12). Its total energy P.E. is mgh, and

$$( \frac { E _ { p } } { F _ { p } } ) = m g h$$

Then the body is allowed to drop to point B at a height x from the ground. The body loses potential energy and gains kinetic energy as it gets speed while falling down. Assuming air resistance negligible.

$$E _ { k } = 0$$

$$E _ { p } = m g \left ( h - x \right )$$

$$\begin{array} { r l } & { E _ { k } = m g x } \\ & { E = m g \left ( h - x \right ) + m g x } & { = m g h } \\ & { \quad } \\ & { E = m g \left ( h - x \right ) + m g x } & { = m g h } \end{array}$$

point B

Total energy at B

Just before hitting the ground at point C, the whole of potential energy is changed into kinetic energy. Thus,

$$E _ { p } = 0 \text { and } E _ { k } = m g h 
 E _ { p } = 0 \text { and } E _ { k } = m g h$$

energy is dissipated as heat and sound in the environment.

## 5.4 Sources of Energy

## Fossil Fuel Energy

Fossil fuel energy comes out from burning of oil, coal and natural gas.These materials areknown asfossil fuels. The burning of these fuels gives out heat which is used to generate steam that runs the turbines to produce electricity.A block diagram of the process going on in electricity generation by fossil fuels is given in Fig.5.13.

Fig.5.13

<!-- image -->

## Hydroelectric Generation

Hydroelectric generation is the electricity generated from the power of falling water. Water in a high lake or reservoir possesses gravitational potential energy stored in it. When water is allowed to fall from height, the potential energy is changed into

Fig.5.14

<!-- image -->

kinetic energy (Fig. 5.14). Tunnels are made for water to flow from the reservoirto a lower place. Such a construction is known as dam.

The kinetic energy of running water rotates the turbine which in turn runs the electric generator.

<!-- image -->

## Solar Energy

Sun is the biggest source of energy. The energy obtained from sunlight is referred to as solar energy. Solar energy can be used in two ways. Either it can be used for heating system or can be converted to electricity. In one way, solar panels absorb heat of the Sun. They consist of large metal plates which are painted black (Fig. 5.15). Heat can be used for warming houses or running water heating system. lf solar radiation is concentrated to a small surface area by using large reflectors or lenses, reasonably high temperature can be achieved.

Fig.5.15 Solar panels installed on the roof

<!-- image -->

Fig.5.16 Solar cells panels

<!-- image -->

At this high temperature, water can be boiled to produce steam that can run the turbine of an electric generator. In this way, electricity can be produced.

In the second method, sunlight is directly transformed to electricity through the use of solar cells. Solar cells are also known as photo voltaic cells. The voltage produced by a single voltaic cell is very low. In order to get sufficient high voltage for practical use, a large number of such cells are connected in series to form a solar cell panel as shown in Fig. 5.16.

Solar calculators are also available which work by using the electrical energy provided by solar cells. Large solar panels are also used to power satellites.

## Nuclear Energy

Nuclear energy is released in the form of heat when an atomic nucleus breaks. Nuclear power stations make use of nuclear fuels such as uranium and plutonium.

These materials release huge amount of energy as the nuclei of their atoms break during nuclear fission,The process is done in a nuclear

Geothermal energy is currently used in Japan,Russia,Iceland, Italy, New Zealand and USA. More than85%of Icelanders use geothermal energy to warm their homes. The cost of heating is only one-third of the cost of burning oil to power electric heaters.

reactor. Heat produced by the fuel is used to make steam that runs the turbines of electric generators. Pakistan also runs nuclear power stations at Karachi and Chashma.

## Geothermal Energy

In some parts of the world, hot rocks are present in the semi molten form deep under the surface of the Earth. They are heated by energy released due to decay of radioactive elements. The temperature of these rocks is about 250°C. This energy is known as geothermal energy which can be extracted to run electric generators. A typical geothermal power plant is shown in Fig. 5.17.

To make use of the heat of the rocks, two holes are drilled up to the rocks. Cold water is pumped down through one of the holes.It is heated up by the hot rocks and starts boiling. Steam is produced that comes out through the other hole. The steam runs the generatorwhich produces electricity. Where there is water already present over the hot

rocks, it comes out of the surface of the Earth in the form of hot springs and geysers. Such a geyseris shown in Fig. 5.18.

## Wind Energy

For thousands of years, people have been using windmillsto draw water from the well or to grind grains into flour. The modern windmill is used to run generators that produce electricity. Wind generators make electricity in the same way as steam generators in power stations. For large scale power generation, a 'wind farm' with a hundred or more windmills is needed. A windmills farm is shown in Fig. 5.19.

## Energy from Tides

The gravitational force for the moon gives rise to tides in the seas. The tide raises the water level near the sea shore twice a day. The rise and fall of water can be utilized to turn on turbine for electricity generation. The water at high tides can be trapped at a suitable location, a basin, by building a dam. The water is then released in a controlled way at low tide to drive the turbines for producing electricity. At next high tide, the dam is filled again and the incoming water also drives turbines.

## Energy from Waves in the Sea

The tides and winds blowing over the surface of the sea produce strong waterwaves.

Their energy can be used to generate electricity. The method to harness wave energy is to use large floats which move up and down with thewaves.One such device invented by Prof. Salter is known as Salter's duck(Fig.5.20). It consists of two parts.

## Biofuel Energy

It is that energy which is obtained from the biomass. Biomass consists of organic materials such as plants, waste foods, animals dung, sewage, etc. Sewage is that dirt which is left over after staining dirty water.The material can itself be used asfuel or can be converted into other types of fuels. Direct combustion is a method in which biomass, commonly known as solid waste, is burnt to boil water and produce steam.The steam can be used to generate electricity. In another process, the rotting of biomass in a closed tank called a 'digester' produces methane rich biogas (Fig. 5.21). In this process, micro-organisms break down biomass material in the absence of oxygen. Biogas produced in the tank is piped out and can be used for heating and cooking like natural gas. O

Biofuel such as ethanol (alcohol) can also be obtained from the biomass. It is a replacement of petrol. In this case, bacteria converts it into ethanol.

## 5.5 Renewable and Non-Renewable Sources

The resources of energy which are replaced by new ones after their use are called renewable energy source. On the other hand, non-renewable sources are those, which are depleted with the continuous use. Once they run out, they are not easily replaced by new ones.Sources such ashydroelectricity,solar

Theradioactive falloutfrom the1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident in Russia (1986) affected people, livestock and crops.Although only 31 people died from direct exposure, about 600,000 people were significantly exposed to the fallout.

## Economic,Social and Environmental Impact of Various Energy Sources

Fossil fuels is a common source of energy but it is very expensive. lt also produces pollution that affects the human health badly. On the other hand, hydroelectric energy is the cheapest source of energy.It does not produce pollution. It has only one negative point that it may cause water logging by raising the water table underthe nearbylands.

The use of solar energy, wind energy. tidal energy, etc. is pollution free. Only the initial cost is high in the use of these sources.

Nuclear energy is very desirable source. It is cheaper and can meet the increasing demands of energy easily.

renewable. These are replaced by new ones. For example, snow fall and rain fall

are continuous processes. Therefore, water supply to the reservoirs of dams for generation of hydroelectric power will never end up. Likewise, solar energy will remain available forever. Same is the case with wind and tidal energy. These are not going to run out in future.

Non-renewable sources include fossil fuels and nuclear energy. The remnants of plants and animals buried under the Earth took millions of years to change into fossil fuels. These fuels are in limited quantity. Once they are used up, it will take are also limited.

As the need for energy is increasing day by day, there is need to develop other non- traditional renewable energy sources.

## 5.6 The Advantages and Disadvantages of Methods of Energy Production

The production of hydroelectric power is more economical and pollution free. The solar power, wind, tidal and wave power need more initial cost but they do not produce pollution and are also economical as well. On the other hand, power generation by fossil fuels and nuclear fuel adds to the pollution of environment. Burning of fossil fuels produces smoke, carbon dioxide gas and heat (Fig. 5.22). .They enhance direct pollution to atmosphere.

## Do You Know?

Burning fossil fuels release five billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere everyyear.

Windmills are very noisy. Some people think that wind turbines spoil the beauty of landscape.

heat energy. Heat itself is a form of pollution. Moreover, there is always dangerof leakage of the radioactive radiation which is harmful to living bodies. People living around nuclear plants are always at risk. The disposal of nuclear waste is energy ends up as thermal energy that goes to the environment. Thus, thermal

## 5.7 Power

In many cases, the time to do work is as important as the amount of work , work, because you are lifting your body up the stairs. lf you run up, you can reach the same height in a shorter time interval.

<!-- image -->

The work done is the same in either case, because the net result is that you lifted stairs, you would be more tired than you walked up slowly. In fact, there is a difference in the rate at which work is done. We say that you expend more energy when you go up the stairs rapidly than when you go slowly.

The concept of power can also be explained with another example of an electric interval of time as compared to a smaller one. It is said that the power of bigger motor is greater than that of smallerone.

## Power isdefined asthe time rate of doing work.

$$P o w r = \frac { W o r k } { T i m e } 
 \text {done in time} t \text { then}$$

## Mathematically,

If W is the work done in time t, then

$$P = \frac { W } { t } \cdots$$

Power of any agency can also be defined as energy transferred per unit time.

## Units of Power

Since both work and time are scalar quantities, so according to Eq.5.5) poweris also a scalar quantity. The Sl unit of powers is watt (W).

One watt is the work done at the rate of one joule per second.

## For Your Information!

The watt is named in honour of James Watt (1736-1819),a Scottish engineer who perfected the steam engine.

## 5.8 Efficiency

The efficiency of a working system tells us what part of the energy can be converted into the required useful form of energy and what part is wasted out of the energy available.

The efficiency of a system is defined as:

The available energy for conversion is usually called the input energy and the energy converted into the required form is known as the output energy.

## For YourInforimation!

Amachine with its output equal to input is called an ideal machine with efficiency100%.

The ratio of useful output energy and the total input energy is called the efficiency of a working system.

$$0 r = \frac { \text {Useful output energy} } { \text {Total input energy} }$$

$$T o t a l i n p u t e n g y$$

Efficiency is often multiplied by 100 to give percentage efficiency. Thus,

$$\text {Percentage Efficiency} = \ \frac { \ u s f u l { o u p t } \ e n g y } { \ t o t a l { i n p u t } \ e n g y } \ \times 1 0 0 \\ \text {It can also be given as:}$$

It is found that the energy output is always less than the energy input. During any conversion of energy, some energy is wasted in the form of heat. No device has That is why a system cannot have an efficiency of 100 %. As the energy losses are inevitable in the working of a machine, hence, an ideal or perpetual machine cannot be constructed.

## Perpetual Energy Machines

It is a hypothetical machine that can do work indefinitely, without any external source of energy. A perpetual machine would have to generate more energy than it consumes, effectively producing energy from nothing, which is impossible for a machine to keep moving without an external source of energy. Infact, it is a consequence of the principle of conservation of energy that a perpetual energy machine is not workable.

## 5.8 Efficiency

The efficiency of a working system tells us what part of the energy can be converted into the required useful form of energy and what part is wasted out of the energy available.

The efficiency of a system is defined as:

The available energy for conversion is usually called the input energy and the energy converted into the required form is known as the output energy.

| Activity       |   Average Efficiency (%) |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Diesel engine  |                       35 |
| Petrol engine  |                       25 |
| Electric motor |                       08 |
| Bicycle        |                       15 |

## For YourInforimation!

Amachine with its output equal to input is called an ideal machine with efficiency100%.

The ratio of useful output energy and the total input energy is called the efficiency of a working system.

$$0 r = \frac { \text {Useful output energy} } { \text {Total input energy} }$$

$$T o t a l i n p u t e n g y$$

Efficiency is often multiplied by 100 to give percentage efficiency. Thus,

$$\text {Percentage Efficiency} = \ \frac { \ u s f u l { o u p t } \ e n g y } { \ t o t a l { i n p u t } \ e n g y } \ \times 1 0 0 \\ \text {It can also be given as:}$$

You have learnt in lower classes that every thing around us is made up of matter. The matter normally exists in solid, liquid and gaseous states. These states are due to attractive force that exists between the atoms and molecules. We have already studied some basic properties of matter. In this chapter, we will discussmechanical properties of matter that are of vital importance of a material included in this chapter are: deformation of solids due to some applied force, density and pressure.

## 6.1 Deformation of Solids

We have observed that an external force applied on an object can change its size or shape. Such a force is known as deforming force. For example, an appropriate force applied to a spring can increase its length called extension or cause compression thus reducing its length. If this force is removed, the spring will restore its original size and shape. Similarly, stretched rubber strip or band comes to its original shape and size on removing the applied force.

When a tennis ball is hit by a racket, the shapes of tennis ball and also racket strings are distorted or deformed (Fig. 6.1). They regain their original shape after bouncing of the ball by the racket. An object is said to be elastic, if after removal of the deforming force, it restores to its original size and shape. This property of the material is known as elasticity. Due to this property. we can determine the strength of a material and the deformation produced under the action of a force.

Most of the materials are elastic up to a certain limit known as elastic limit. Beyond the elastic limit, the

## For Your Information!

Some materials such as clay dough or plasticine donot return to their original shape after the removalofthe deforming force. They are known as inelastic materials.

change becomes permanent. The object or material does not regain its original shape or size even after the removal of the deforming force.

## 6.2 Hooke's Law

If a force Fis applied on a spring to stretch or compress it, the extension or compression x has been found directly proportional to the applied force within the elastic limit. Thus, or

$$\begin{matrix} F \circ c \, x \\ F \, \bot \end{matrix}$$

$$k = \frac { F } { x }$$

where k is the constant of proportionality and is known as spring constant. In fact, it is a measure of stiffness of the spring. The greater the value of spring constant, the greater will be the stiffness or strength of the spring. Its unit is N m-.

A graph of force against extension is a straight line passing through the origin. If the applied force or load exceeds the elastic limit of the spring, it is permanently deformed and its graph will no longer remain linear. The gradient or slope of force-extension graph is a measure of spring constantk.

Fig. 6.2

Hooke's law also holds when a force is applied to a straight thin wire or a rubber band within its elasticlimit.

## Activity 6.1

## Applications of Hooke's Law

Hooke's law serves as the basicprinciple in wide range of applications. In law for their functions such as spring scales, balance wheel of the mechanical clocks,galvanometer, suspensions system in vehicles and motorbikes, door hinges, mattresses, material testing machines, etc.

However, Hooke's law applies within a specific range of forces. Exceeding the range or limit results in permanent deformation and no longer follows Hooke's law. Some of the uses are elaboratedbelow:

## 1. Spring scales

Spring scales use the extension or compression of a spring to determine the weight of objects.In a common spring balance the extension or elongation produced is a measure of the weight. In compression balance, the spring is compressed by the load (force) and the compression produced is measured by means of a

pointer moving over a scale. Weighing machine usually use this type of balance.

## 2. Balance wheel of mechanical clocks

The balance wheel in mechanical clocks use spring to control the back and forth motion that regulates the speed of the hands of a clock (Fig. 6.4).

## 3. Galvanometer

Galvanometer is a current detecting device. It makes use of a tiny spring called hair spring (Fig. 6.5) which provides electrical connections to the galvanometer coil and also restores the pointer back to zero position. The deflection of the pointer is proportional to the current flowing through it within the range.

## 6.3 Density

If you take equal volumes of different substances and weigh them by a balance, you will

<!-- image -->

find that each of them has a different mass. That is, one centimetre cube of wood may weigh only 0.7 g but made of iron will weigh 8.0 g. Why is it so? You know that all substances are composed of molecules. The molecules of different substances are different in size and mass. The inter-molecular spacing is also different.

Themass of equal volume of various substances actually is the mass of the total number of molecules present in that volume. Naturally, the substance whose molecules are densely packed and also which are heavy will weigh more than others.

Density of a substance is defined as its mass per unit volume.

## ForYour Information!

Packing foam or polythene has a very low density.

## Quick Quiz

How will you measure the volume if the object is lighter than the liquid?

## For Your Informationl

Density is a test to know the purity of a substance.

$$\ D e n s { \iota } { y } = \frac { \ M a s s } { \ V o l u m e } \quad \dots \quad \dots \quad ( 6 . 2 )$$

The Sl unit of density is kg m. Other unit also in use is g cm?. Table 7.1 shows the density of some substances.

The architects and engineers take special care of the density of the building material to be used in designing and constructing roads, bridges and buildings. The density of building material is essential for estimating the strength required in foundations and supporting pillars.

Example 6.1 The length, breath and thickness of an iron block are 3 cm, 2 cm, 2 cm respectively. Calculate the density of iron if the mass of block is 94 g.

Length =3cm,Breath = 2 cm, Thickness = 2 cm, Mass = 94 g, Density = ?

Using Eq. 6.2

$$\ D e n s i t y = \frac { \ M a s s } { V o l u r m e }$$

where Volume =Length x Breadthx Thickness =3cm×2cm×2cm=12cm²

94 g Hence, Density = = 7.8 g cm12 cm²

Thus, density of iron = 7800 kg m²3

find that each of them has a different mass. That is, one centimetre cube of wood may weigh only 0.7 g but made of iron will weigh 8.0 g. Why is it so? You know that all substances are composed of molecules. The molecules of different substances are different in size and mass. The inter-molecular spacing is also different.

Themass of equal volume of various substances actually is the mass of the total number of molecules present in that volume. Naturally, the substance whose molecules are densely packed and also which are heavy will weigh more than others.

Density of a substance is defined as its mass per unit volume.

## Quick Quiz

How will you measure the volume if the object is lighter than the liquid?

## For Your Informationl

Density is a test to know the purity of a substance.

$$\ D e n s { \iota } { y } = \frac { \ M a s s } { \ V o l u m e } \quad \dots \quad \dots \quad ( 6 . 2 )$$

The Sl unit of density is kg m. Other unit also in use is g cm?. Table 7.1 shows the density of some substances.

The architects and engineers take special care of the density of the building material to be used in designing and constructing roads, bridges and buildings. The density of building material is essential for estimating the strength required in foundations and supporting pillars.

Example 6.1 The length, breath and thickness of an iron block are 3 cm, 2 cm, 2 cm respectively. Calculate the density of iron if the mass of block is 94 g.

## Solution

Length =3cm,Breath = 2 cm, Thickness = 2 cm, Mass = 94 g, Density = ?

Using Eq. 6.2

$$\ D e n s i t y = \frac { \ M a s s } { V o l u r m e }$$

## Density Measurement

Density of a substance can be determined by measuring its mass and volume. The mass can be easily measured bya physical balance.

## Quick Quiz

By which property can you identify a silver spoon and a stainless steel spoon?

If the substance is solid and has a regular shape, its volume can be found by measuring its dimensions. For example, if the substance is in the form of a sphere, its diameter can be measured by a Vernier Callipers and volume is thereby calculated. Knowing mass and volume, the density can be found out. If the solid has not a geometrical shape, its volume is determined by the following activity:

## Activity:6.2

Teacher should facilitate to help the groups to pour some water in a measuring cylinder.lIf the substance is soluble in water, then use a liquid in which the substance is insoluble.Note the level of the liquid in the cylinder. Now gently drop the substance into the cylinder.The rise in the level gives the volumeof the substance.

## 6.4 Pressure

If a wooden rod has a flat end, it will be very diffcult to push it into ground. On the other hand, if it has a pointed end, it can be easily pushed into the ground. In the first case, the applied force is spread over a large area, whereas in the second case, the force is concentrated on a small area. The force applied on the rod will exert greater pressure in the second case thanin the first one.

Pressure is defined as the force exerted normally on unit area of an object.

If F is the force acting normally on a surface of areaA, then pressure P on the surface is given by

## For Your Information!

$$P = \frac { F } { A } \, \dots$$

Sports boots for football and hockey have studs on their soles. They reduce the area in contact between your feet and the ground.This increases the pressure and your feet grip the surface more firmly.

<!-- image -->

## For Your Information!

<!-- image -->

The force in both the pictures is same, equal to weight of the bag. In right hand picture, the area of contact is the greater than in the left hand picture. We say that the pressure is less in the right hand picture.

<!-- image -->

The area A on which the force acts is usually referred as contact area. Equation (6.3) shows that for a certain force, the pressure can be very large if the contact area A is small.

In the system international, the unit of pressure is N m² and is called pascal (Pa).

## Daily Life Examples

1. The edge of theblade of a chopper is made very sharp. When we apply force on the handle of the chopper to cut an object, the pressure on the object, at the contact surface, due to its small area becomes very high and the object is easily cut (Fig. 6.6).
3. When we walk on ground, we exert a force on it due to which we experience a reaction force. When the ground is flat, this reaction force is spread over the whole area of the foot and the pressure due to reaction force is not painful. But when we walk on pebbles, the contact area is reduced. Then the pressure due to reaction force becomes so high that it becomes painful.

4. Heavy animals like elephant have thick legs and large flat feet so that due to large contact area,pressure becomes less otherwise, their bones would not tolerate the pressure.

## 6.5 Pressure in Liquids

We have learnt in the lower classes that liquids exert pressure in all directions. Moreover, liquid pressure increases with depth.

Let us determine the pressure at a certain depth of a liquid. Figure. 6.8 shows a container of liquid. Consider an area A in the liquid at depth h. The force acting on this area is equal to the weight of the liquid column over surface A. The volume of this liquid is V = Ah. If p is the density of liquid, then mass m of the liquid column will be:

m=pV=pAh

2. The top of a thumb pin is flat but the end of the pin is very sharp. So, the contact area is very small. When we apply a force at the top, the pressure at the end of pin is so high that it pierces into the wooden board (Fig. 6.7).

Therefore, force acting on area A will be F=mg=pAhg

The pressure P at areaA will be,

$$P = \frac { F } { A } \, = \frac { \rho A h g } { A } \\ D = \frac { A } { B }$$

$$0 r = \rho g h$$

Equation 6.4 shows that pressure in a liquid increases with depth. The value of pressure depends on the depth and density of the liquid.

Pressure produces force at right angle to the surface. A force or its component that is parallel to the surface, does not contribute to pressure. The pressure, by definition, is only

<!-- image -->

contributed by the normal component of the force. That is, the forces in a liquid that push directly against the surface and add up to a net force is perpendicular to the surface. If there is a hole in the surface of the liquid container, the liquid spurts at right angle to the surface before curying downward due to gravity.

## Example 6.2

Calculate the pressure of column of mercury 76 cm high. Density of mercury is 13.6 x 10 kg m².

## Solution

Density p=13.6x10²kgm²

Height

h= 76cm=76×10²m

g= 10ms²

As Pressure = pgh

P=13.6×10²kgm²×10ms²×76×10²m

P = 1.034×10kgm²3×ms²×m

P = 1.034×10Nm²

P=1.034x10° Pa

## Example 6.3

A cylindrical water tank 2 m deep has been built on the top of a building 20 m high. What will be the pressure of water at the ground floor when the tank is full? Density of water is 1000 kg m². Takeg = 10m s

## For YourInformation!

Some liquids under pressure can dissolve more gas than a liquid ata lower pressure.When we open a bottle of soda water, the pressure in the bottle is decreased.

You will observe thatthe stream from each hole,initially flows outnormal to thesurfacebefore curving down due to gravity and the lowest hole has more pressure.It shows that liquid pressure increases with depth.

in all directions. lt means the pressure is transmitted equally throughout the liquid.

## 6.6 Atmospheric Pressure

The Earth is surrounded by a layer of air which we call atmosphere. We know that air is a mixture of gases. Their molecules are always in motion. They collide with one another and with all other objects coming in their way. Thus, they Since the molecules of air have random motion, therefore, atmospheric pressure acts equally in all directions.

The atmosphere exerts pressure on the surface of the Earth and on everything on the Earth. This pressure is called atmospheric pressure.

<!-- image -->

Atmospheric pressure extends up to a height of about 100 kilometres. The density of air is not the same in the atmosphere. It decreases continuously with altitude.

## Do You Know?

The pressure of 1 atmosphere is equivalent to placing a 1.0 kg mass (10 N weight) on an area of 1 cm².

We live at the bottom of the Earth's atmosphere which is afluid that exerts pressure on our bodies.At sea level, the value of atmospheric pressure is about 1.013 x 10 Pa. This value is referred to as standard atmospheric pressure. It is an practically all the bodies have air inside them. As atmospheric pressure acts in all directions, so it balances the pressure inside.

## Evidence of Atmospheric Pressure

We can observe the force of the atmospheric pressure if we remove the inside air from a vessel as shown in the following activity.

## Variation of Atmospheric Pressure with Height

We have studied that pressure in a liquid increases with depth. At depth h, the pressure of liquid is given by

## P=pgh

This formula is applicable to all the fluids. As the gases of the atmosphere are also fluid, therefore, the atmospheric pressure should be maximum on the ground at sea level. As we go up in the air, atmospheric pressure decreases. At a height of about 5 km, it falls to 55 kPa and at a height of 30 km, it falls to 1 kPa. By measuring the atmospheric pressure at a point in air, altitude of that point can be determined. The lowerthe atmospheric pressure,the greater is the altitude.

## 6.7 Measurement of Atmospheric Pressure

Atmospheric pressure is usually measured by the height of mercury column which it can support. Instruments which measure the atmospheric pressure are called barometers. A simple mercury barometer consists of a glass tube about one metre long that is closed at one end. It is completely filled with mercury, then it is inverted vertically in a dish of mercury.A metre scale is placed by the side of the tube tomeasure the height of mercury column (Fig. 6.9). The space in glass tube over the top of the mercury is completely empty. The pressure is almost zero.

The pressure P, at point A in the mercury column is the same as at point B at the surface ofmercury in the dish because both the points are at the same level. This is equal to the atmospheric pressure P pgh acting at the surface of mercury in the dish.

Ifwe put P=1.013x10Pa at sea level, p = 13.6 x 10² kg m² for mercury, the height of mercury column comes out to be 760 mm. By using this instrument, atmospheric pressure at any altitude in the air can be measured in terms of height of mercury column.

pressure falls down. Similarly, increase in the quantity of water vapours also decreases the density. Thus, atmospheric pressure becomes low in cloudy regions. Weather casters use this knowledge to predict rains. A fall in pressure often means that rain clouds are on the way and the rain is to follow.

## 6.8 Measurement of Pressure by Manometer

A simple manometer consists of a U-shaped glass tube which contains mercury. In the beginning, the atmospheric pressure at the two open ends of the tube is the same and hence, mercury level in the two arms remains same (Fig. 6.10). If on connecting a gas cylinder with short arm keeping the longer arm of the tube open, the mercury level in short arm is lower than that in the long arm (Fig. 6.11), then the unknown pressure is more than the atmospheric pressure. If the mercury level in the short arm is more than the long arm (Fig.6.12), then the unknown pressure is less than the atmospheric pressure.

## 6.9 Pascal's Law

When we inflate a balloon, we blow air in it with a certain pressure but the balloon blows uniformly from all sides. It means that the pressure applied at its mouth has been transmitted uniformly in all directions. Similarly, when a motorbike tyre is inflated, air pressure is applied at one point but the tyre is uniformly inflated from all sides. This indicates that pressure is transmitted to each part of the tyre.

Let us perform a very interesting activity with a liquid. Take water in a flask with piston and having a few side tubes fixed at different positions. If such flask is not available you can join a syringe at the mouth of a pet bottle. For side tubes, bendable transparent drinking straws can be glued on the holes punched on sides of the bottle.

You will observe that the level of water in all the side tubes is the same. This is because a liquid seeks its own level and rises to the same height at all points. Now push the piston through some distance.

The level of water in all the side tubes rises to the same height. Why does this happen? This is because the pressure applied at one point of the liquid is transmitted equally to every point of the liquid. Since gases (air) and liquids are termed as fluids so the above activities prove that:

When pressure is applied at one point in an enclosed fluid,it is transmitted equally to all parts of fluid without loss.

<!-- image -->

This is the statement of Pascal's law.

- (1) Liquids do not absorb any of the supplied energy.

The technology of hydraulic systems is based on Pascal's law. Its main advantages are:

- (i) They are capable of moving much heavy loads and providing great forces due to incompressibility.
- 1.Hydraulic press

Some useful hydraulic systems are:

2. Car lift at service stations
2. 3.Hydraulic brakes of vehicles

## Hydraulic Press

Consider a specially designed container as shown in Fig. 6.14. In this container there are two cylinders joined by means of a pipe. The cross-sectional area of the smaller cylinder is A, and that of the larger one is A2 The cylinders are filled with some incompressible liquid.

Suppose that the small piston is pressed down by applying a force F,The pressure P=F/ A produced by small piston is transmitted equally to the large piston.

Due to this pressure P, a force Fz will act on A, which is given by

$$F _ { 2 } = P A _ { 2 }$$

Putting the value of P,

<!-- image -->

$$F _ { 2 } = \frac { F _ { 1 } } { A _ { 1 } } A _ { 2 } \, \dots \, \dots \, \dots \, ( 6 . 5 )$$

Since A2 &gt; A, therefore, F2 &gt;F1. The result indicates that a small force applied on the smaller piston, results into a large force on the larger piston. Such a system is known as force multiplier.

A hydraulic press works on this principle. Cotton bale or any other object to the larger piston.A much greater force F, acts on it. This force lifts the larger piston and compresses the cotton bale.

This principle is also used at service stations to lift cars for washing (Fig. 6.15).

## Example 6.4

<!-- image -->

The diameters of the pistons of a hydraulic press are 5 cm and 25 cm respectively. A normal force of 160 N is applied on the smaller piston, what will be

the pressure exerted by this force on the bigger piston? How much weight can be lifted by the other piston?

## Solution

Let the areas of cross-sections of the pistons be A, and A and their radi be r, and r,respectively.

$$P \text { putting the values of } r _ { 1 } = \frac { 5 } { 2 } \, \text { cm} = 2 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 } \, m \, \ r _ { 2 } = \frac { 2 5 } { 2 } \, \text { cm} = 1 2 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 } \, m \\ A _ { 1 } = \pi \, r _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } \quad \text {and} \quad A _ { 2 } = \pi \, r _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } \\ \text {For on the smaller picton } \, F _ { 1 } = 1 6 \, \text {N} \, \coprod 1 + \text {to} \, \text {accessory on the picton} \, j _ { 1 }$$

Force on the smaller piston F1 = 160 N. Its pressure on the piston is

JO

Putting the values,

W =160 N ×(12.5 × 10² m)² /(2.5 × 10² m)² = 4000 N = 4 kN So, we can lift 4000 N weight by applying a force of 160 N on smaller piston.

## Hydraulic Brakes

The brakes of some vehicles work on Pascal's law. In such type of brakes, cylinders with pistons are attached to the wheels.The brake cylinder having smaller area of cross-section. Master cylinder is connected to all the larger cylinders attached to the wheel through pipes as shown in Fig. 6.16. Oil is filled in this system. When pedal is pushed down, the piston applies pressure on the liquid in the master cylinder. The liquid pressure is transmitted

the pressure exerted by this force on the bigger piston? How much weight can be lifted by the other piston?

## Solution

Let the areas of cross-sections of the pistons be A, and A and their radi be r, and r,respectively.

$$P \text { putting the values of } r _ { 1 } = \frac { 5 } { 2 } \, \text { cm} = 2 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 } \, m \, \ r _ { 2 } = \frac { 2 5 } { 2 } \, \text { cm} = 1 2 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 } \, m \\ A _ { 1 } = \pi \, r _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } \quad \text {and} \quad A _ { 2 } = \pi \, r _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } \\ \text {For on the smaller picton } \, F _ { 1 } = 1 6 \, \text {N} \, \coprod 1 + \text {to} \, \text {accessory on the picton} \, j _ { 1 }$$

Force on the smaller piston F1 = 160 N. Its pressure on the piston is

JO

Putting the values,

W =160 N ×(12.5 × 10² m)² /(2.5 × 10² m)² = 4000 N = 4 kN So, we can lift 4000 N weight by applying a force of 160 N on smaller piston.

$$\frac { F _ { 1 } } { A _ { 1 } } = & \frac { w } { A _ { 2 } } \\ w = & \frac { F , A _ { 2 } } { A _ { 1 } } = \frac { F ; \Pi r _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } } { \pi r _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } } = \frac { F _ { 1 } \times r _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } \times \hat { \mathcal { O } } } { \hat { \times } r _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } }$$

equally to all the larger pistons of other cylinders. This pressure causes these pistons to move outward pressing the brake pads towards brake discs or brake drums. Force of friction between the pads and discs or drums slows down the vehicle. When pressure is released from the pedal, the springs pull back the brake pads and wheels again turn freely.

Heat or thermal energy has always been the necessity of human beings, animals and plants in this world. Without heat, their existence would not have been possible. In the beginning, the Sun was the only source of light and heat. With the discovery of fire,a new era was started.The uses of heat produced from facilities for the human being. Initially, the hot and cold objects were sensed by touching which was not a good standard to measure the degree of hotness of an

object. So, man evolved different methods to measure it. After the invention of standard measuring devices, the temperature was also included in the list of basic physical quantities like mass, length and time.

This chapter begins with the introduction of kinetic molecular theory of particles of matter. It is due to the fact that temperature and heat or internal energy are associated with the motion of particles in the matter.

## 7.1 Kinetic Molecular Theory of Matter

According to this theory, matter is composed of very small particles called molecules which are always in motion. Their motion may be vibrational, rotational or linear. There exists a mutual force of attraction between the molecules known as intermolecular force. This force depends upon the distance between the molecules. It decreases with increasing distance between them.

<!-- image -->

The molecules possess kinetic energy due to motion and potential energy due to force of attraction. When a substance is heated, its temperature rises and its molecularmotion becomes more vigorous which increases the kinetic energy of the molecules. Thus, the temperature of the substance depends upon the average kinetic energy of its molecules. In general, matter exists in three states solids, liquids and gases as shown in Fig. 7,1.

Most of the properties of solids, liquids and gases can be explained on the basis of kinetic molecular theory of matter. In case of solids, the intermolecular forces are so strong that they keep the molecules bound. So, the molecules are held at fixed positions but still they show vibrational motion about their fixed points (Fig. 7.2). This is why, the solids have a definite shape and a definite volume.

In case of liquids, intermolecular force is so weak that it cannot hold the molecules at fixed positions and the

Fig. 7.2

<!-- image -->

molecules can slide over each other in random directions. A liquid, therefore, possesses a definite volume but has no definite shape.Due to flow of the molecules, it acquires the shape ofthe containing vessel.

Gas molecules are relatively far away from one and another. Due to which, gas neither posseses a definite volume nor a definite shape.

## Plasma

The plasma is a gas in which most of the atoms are ionized containing positive ions and electrons (Fig. 7.3-a). They are freely moving in the volume of the gas. Due to presence of positive ions and free electrons, plasma is the conducting state of matter. It allows electric current to pass through it. Since the gas in plasma state has properties which are quite different from ordinary gas, therefore, plasma is known as fourth

state of matter. The Sun and the most of other stars are in plasma state. Plasma is also found in plasma TV and in gas discharge tubes (Fig. 7.3-b) when electric stages of lightning formation known as lightning streamers which are the conducting paths through the atmosphere due to ionized air molecules.

## 7.2 Temperature and Heat

When we touch ice, we feel cold. When we dip our fingers in warm water, we feel hot. Thus, by sense of touch we can tell which of the bodies is colder or hotter. A hotter body is said to be at higher temperature as compared to a colder body.

Temperature of a body is defined as degree ofitshotness or coldness.

It is our common experience that when we heat a body, its temperature rises. Process of heating provides heat or thermal energy to the body which is the cause of the rise in temperature.

<!-- image -->

The following activity will help to define temperature.

## Activity7.1

The teacher should arrange hot water in some tea cups, thermometers and metal spoons. Make groups of the students. Each group will put the spoon in the hot water and stir it. Ask themwhat do they feel. Does the other end of the spoon alsobecome hot?

Fig.7.4

Do they observe thatthespoon alsogetshotter?It meansheatisbeing transferred from the hotwater to the spoon because the temperature of thewater was higher than that of the spoon.

Temperature can be defined as a physical quantity which determines the direction of flow of thermal energy.

Thus

This means that thermal energy is transferred from one object to another due to temperature difference of the two bodies. Therefore, we can define heat as follows:

Heat is the energy which is transferred from one object to another due to difference of temperature between the two bodies.

## Temperature and Internal Energy

Weknow that matter is composed of molecules which are always in motion.Molecules of a solid are vibrating about their fixed positions. The molecules of a liquid are sliding one over the other and those of gases are randomly moving. The molecules possess kinetic energy on account of their motion. Potential energy is also associated with molecules because of theirattractiveforces. S

Fig. 7.5 The internal energy of air inside a hot-air balloon increases as thetemperature increases.

<!-- image -->

The sum of kinetic and potential energies of the molecules of an object is called its internal energy.

When we heat a substance, its molecular motion becomes more vigorous which means an increase in its internal energy. As a result, temperature of the substance rises. The heat energy transferred to a body increases the internal energy of its molecules due to which its temperature rises.

Remember that, it is not true to say that a substance contains heat. The substance contains internal energy. The word heat is used only when referring to the energy actually in transit from hot to cold body.

## 7.3 Thermometers

## 7.3 Thermometers

Our sense of touch can tell us whether an object is hot or cold. It gives an idea about the object's temperature but we cannot measure the actual

temperature of the body just by touching it. For the exact measurement of the hotness of a substance, we require an instrument called a thermometer.

Thermometers use some property of a substance, which changes appreciablywith the changeof temperature.

## Basic Thermometric Properties

Some basic thermometric properties for a material suitable to construct a thermometerare the following:

1. It is a good conductor of heat.
2. It gives quick response to temperature changes.
4. It has high boiling point.
3. It has uniform thermal expansion.
5. It has low freezing point.
6. It has large expansivity (low specific heat capacity).
7. It does not wet glass.
8. It does not vapourize.
9. It is visible.

## Liquid-in-Glass Thermometer

We know that liquids expand on heating. So, expansion in the volume of a liquid can be used for the measurement of temperature. This is known as liquid-in-glass thermometer. One such liquid which is commonly used in thermometers is mercury. Figure 7.6 shows a mercury thermometer.It is made of glass. It has a bulb at one end filled with mercury.

<!-- image -->

When the temperature rises, the mercury expands and moves up through the narrow capillary tube in the form of a mercury thread. As shown in Fig. 7.6, the position of the end of thread reads the temperature. Mercury is opaque and can be easily seen due to its silvery colour. Alcohol is also a choice for the thermometric liquid, butit must be coloured tomakeit visible.

## Point to Ponder!

Could we make mercury thermometer if expansion of glass would have been greater than mercury?

## Brain Teaser!

- (a) Why the walls of the thermometer bulb are thin?
- (b) Why the inner bore must be narrow?

## Temperature Scales

For the measurement of temperature, a scale is to be constructed which requires two reference temperatures called two fixed points. One is the steam point slightly above the boiling of water at standard atmospheric pressure. This corresponds to upper fixed point of the scale. The second fixed point is the melting point of pure ice or simply ice point. It is called the lower fixed point. Different scales of temperature have been constructed by assigning different numerical values to these fixed points. Three different scales are:

- (i) Celsius or centigrade scale
- (i) Fahrenheit scale

In Celsius or centigrade scale, the numerical values assigned to lower and upper fixed points are 0 and 100. As the difference between these values is 100, so the space between these points is divided into 100 equal parts. Each part is known as 1°C.

- (i) Kelvin scale

In Fahrenheit scale, the lower fixed point is labelled as 32 andupper as 212. As the difference between these two numbers is 180, so in this scale the space between these points is divided into 180 equal parts. Each part is known as 1°F. Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are generally used in ordinary life.

There is a third scale of temperature known as Kelvin scale or Absolute temperature scale. It is used in scientific measurements. In Kelvin scale, the lower and upper fixed points are labelled as 273 and 373.As the difference between these values is 100, so the width of 1 K is the same as that of 1°C. The zero point of this scale is the temperature at which the molecules

## For YourInformation!

The pressure of a given mass of gas increases with temperature. So, pressure of a gas is also a thermometric property which is used in gas thermometers. The resistance ofa given length of wire also depends upon temperature. It increases with the increase in temperature. So, the resistance of a wire is also a thermometric substance and is used in platinum resistance thermometer.

divisions 8

of a substance cease to move. Their average kinetic energy becomes zero. This is known as absolute zero. Its value is -273.15 °C. For calculations, it is simply taken as -273 °C.Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature ever to be in the wholeuniverse.Thematter doesnotexistbelow absolute zero temperature.

## Conversion of Temperature from One Scale to Another

If the temperature of a body is T,on Celsius scale, T;on Fahrenheit scale and TonKelvinscale, then these readings are related bythe following formulae:

- Conversion of Celsius(centigrade)to

Fahrenheit scale:

$$T _ { _ { F } } = \frac { 9 } { 5 } \times T _ { c } + 3 2 \quad \dots \quad ( 7 . 1 )$$

- (ii) Conversion of Fahrenheit to Celsius scale:

$$T _ { c } = \frac { 5 } { 9 } \left ( T _ { F } - 3 2 \right )$$

- (m) Relationship between Kelvin and Celsius scales:

$$T _ { k } = T _ { c } + 2 7 3$$

## Example 7.1

How much 30°C temperature would be on Fahrenheit and Kelvin scales?

## Solution

Temperature T= 30°C

$$\begin{array} { r l } & { \text {temperature} ^ { - } T _ { c } = 3 0 ^ { \circ } C } \\ & { \text {Using} \quad T _ { f } = \frac { 9 } { 5 } \times T _ { c } \, + 3 2 ^ { \circ } } \\ & { \quad = \frac { 9 } { 5 } \times 3 0 ^ { \circ } C + 3 2 ^ { \circ } = 8 6 ^ { \circ } F } \\ & { \quad \text {Using} \quad T _ { k } = T _ { c } + 2 7 3 } \\ & { \quad = 3 0 ^ { \circ } C + 2 7 3 = 3 0 3 K } \end{array} \, { o b s i l }$$

## Thermocouple Thermometer

This type of thermometerconsists of two wires of different materials such

as copper and iron. Their ends are joined together to form two junctions. If the two junctions are at different temperatures, a small current flows across them. This current is due to the potential difference produced across the two junctions as the two wires have different resistance to the flow of current. The greater is the difference of temperatures, the greater is the potential difference or voltage produced across the junctions. If one end of the junction is

kept at a fixed lower temperature, say by placing it in an ice bath at 0°c for measured using a millivolt meter by a calibrated scale on it (Fig. 7.8).

This type of thermometer is particularly useful forvery high temperatures (the junction) to heat up.

## 7.4 Sensitivity, Range and Linearity of Thermometers

A thermometer is evaluated by its three key characteristics that are sensitivity, range and linearity. They help determine the suitability of the thermometer for specific use ensuring accurate and reliable measurement of temperature. or

## Sensitivity

Sensitivity of a thermometer refers to its ability to detect small changes in the temperature of an object. For example, the minimum division on the scale of a thermometer is 1°C. The accuracy of its temperature measurement will be 1°C. On another thermometer the marks are 0.1°C apart. Hence, its accuracy will be up to 0.1°C and said to be more sensitive. Its measurement will be more precise than the measurement bya thermometer with an accuracy of 1°℃.

## Range

This refers to the span of temperature,from low to high,overwhich the thermometer can measure accurately.For example, a clinical thermometer 35°C to 45°C. A long-range thermometer is usually used for science experiments in the laboratory with markings from -10°C to 110°C. The choice of liquid for

thermometers put a lower and upper limit for the range of a thermometer. For example, Mercury freezes at -39°C and boils at 357°C. Hence, we can construct mercury in glass thermometers within this range. The marking scale depends on desired range of measurement.Forextremelylow temperatures, alcohol is used. Alcohol has a much lower freezing point about -112°C which increases its lower limit for the range but it has lower upper limit as it boils at 78 °℃.

## Linearity

This refers to a direct proportional relationship between the temperature and scale reading across entire range of measurement. A good linear thermometer should measure equal increments on the scale corresponding to equal change in the temperature. It means that marking on the scale should be evenly spaced over the whole range. High linearity means more consistent and proportional scale readings over the entire range to ensure accuracy of measurement.

## 7.5 Structure of a Liquid-in-Glass Thermometer

A liquid-in-glass thermometer has a narrow and uniform capillary tube having a small bulb filled with mercury or alcohol at its lower end. The thin wall of the glass bulb allows quick conduction through glass to the liquid from a hot object whose temperature is to be measured. Mercury being metal is a good conductor and hence responds quickly to the change in temperature. The small quick response makes the device sensitive. Use of mercury is quite sensitive for normal measurements.For greater accuracy, alcohol can be used as its temperature measurements due to its low boiling point (78°C).

The uniformity of the narrow tube or bore ensures even expansion of the liquid required to make the linear measuring scale. The choice of mercury allows to use it over a long-range temperature due to its low freezing point and high boiling point. It provides a fairly long range of measurement of temperature.

## 8.1 Magnetic Materials

Magnetism is a force that acts at a distance upon magnetic materials. These materials are attracted to magnets. These materials are called magnetic materials. Let us perform an activity to test such materials.

## Activity1

The teacher should divide the students into groups and provide them permanent magnets to perform this activity.

Each group should collect some items made of different materials such as copperwire,nickel ring, glass bottle, paper clips, iron nail, eraser, wooden ruler,plasticcomb,etc.Place themona tableasshown in figure. Bring the permanent magnet close to each item one by one and observe which items are

<!-- image -->

attracted by the magnet and which are not. Make a list of magnetic and non magnetic materials.

Materials such as iron,nickel and cobalt will be attracted by the magnet.They are magnetic materials. The materials such as brass, copper,wood, glass and plastic are not attracted by the magnet.They are called non-magneticmaterials.

We will discuss different types of materials in detail later in this chapter.

## ForYourInformation!

Over 10o0 years ago, the Greeks discovered a rock called lodestone or magnetite that could attract materials thatcontained iron.Also,if suspended from a string torotate freely,it would always settle in north-south direction. This unique property led to form the basis of compass which was later on used fornavigation on land and at sea.

## Activity2

The teacher should facilitate each group to perform this activity as per instructions.

1. Place some iron filings scattered on the topof acard paperorasheetof glass.
2. Move a magnet beneath the card paper, glassor a plasticsheet as shown in the figure.
3. What do you observe?Describe briefly.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You must have seen the iron filings following the movement of the magnet. Magnetic force accounts for these movements. This activity also shows that magnets can attract objects containing iron, etc. even if they are not in direct contact with them.

## 8.2 Properties of Magnets

The property of attracting magnetic materials by the magnets has been discussed above. The magnets also exhibit the following properties.

## 1. Magnetic Poles

Ifa bar magnet is suspended horizontally through a string and allowed to come to rest, it will point in north-south direction. The end of the magnet that points north is called the north magnetic pole (N) and rhe end that points south is the south magnetic pole (S) as shown in Fig. 8.1.

## 2.Attraction and Repulsion of Magnetic Poles

When two freely suspended bar magnets are placed close to each other, the two north poles will repel each other (Fig. 8.2). So will the two south poles (Fig. 8.3).

However, if the north pole of one is placed near the south pole of the other, the poles will attract (Fig. 8.4 &amp; Fig. 8.5). We can say that Like poles repel and unlike poles attract.

## 3. Identification of a Magnet

To identify whether an object is a magnet or simply a magnetic material, we can bring its one end close to any pole of a suspended bar magnet. lf it is attracted, then we can conclude that the end of the object is either of opposite pole to that of the

<!-- image -->

suspended magnet or it is simply a magnetic material. Then we should bring the same end of the object close to the other end of the suspended magnet. If the object is again attracted, it is not a magnet but it is a magnetic material.

magnet.

The repulsion between the like poles is a real test to identify a magnet.

## 4. Is Isolated Magnetic Pole Possible?

If we break a bar magnet into two equal pieces, can we get N-pole and S-pole separately? No, it is not possible. Each piece will have its two poles, i.e., N-pole and S-pole. Even if a magnet is divided into thousands pieces, each piece will be a complete magnet with its N, and S-poles (Fig.8.6).

## 8.3 Induced Magnetism

Magnetic material such as iron or steel can be made a magnet. This is known as magnetization. In other words, we can say that magnetism has induced in it. You can perform an activity to observe this fact.

## Activity3

The teacher should facilitate each group to perform this activity as perinstructions.

- The N-pole of the needle is usually coloured red.
- 2 Place a bar magnet on the table.Bring the compass near to its N-pole.In which direction does the N-pole of the needle stay?
- 3.Put the compass nearto the S-pole ofthe barmagnet.In which direction does the N-pole of the needle stay this time?
- 4.
- 5.Put the compass near to the pointed end of an iron nail. Observe the direction in which N-pole of the needle settles. Has the nail become a magnet? Has magnetism been inducedinit?
6. compass near to its ends. Does the magnetism vanish?
- From the above activity,we conclude that the S-pole of the true magnet induces N-pole in the near end of the piece of iron (nail) while the far end of the iron piece becomes S-pole as shown in the figure.
- It should be noted that the induced magnetism vanishes as the true magnet is removed.

## 8.4 Temporary and Permanent Magnets

Temporary magnets are the magnets that work in the presence of a lose their magnetic properties. You have learnt something about a magnetic field in lower classes. In this chapter, we will study it in detail.

Usually, soft iron is used to make temporary magnets. Paper clips, office pins and iron nails can easily be made temporary magnets. Electromagnets are also good examples of temporary magnets. You have already learnt different usesofelectromagnets.

some special alloys in a strong magnetic field for a sufficient time. There are many types of permanent magnetic materials. For example cobalt, alnico and ferrite.

## Activity 4

The teacher should facilitate the groups to provide each a bar magnet,a stand with clamp,some small nailsmade of iron and also some nailsof steel.He should further supervise them to perform the activity as perinstructions.

1. Clamp the bar magnet horizontally on the stand.
2. Touch the head of an iron nail to anyone end of the magnet. It will be attracted and stick to the magnet. Touch another iron nail to the lower end of the first one,doesitstickto it?
3. Yes, it will, because the upper nail has become a magnet itself. Go on hanging iron nail one by one to makea chain until no morenails stay attached to the chain.
3. Try to hang steel nails at the other end of the bar magnetto forma similarchain.
4. Remove the chain of iron nailsby pulling the topmost nail.Does the chain collapse?
6. 5.
7. Remove the chain of steel nails in the same way.Does this collapse? You will observe that the chain of iron nails immediately collapses but the steel nails remain attached to each other for some time.This shows that the magnetism induced in the iron nails is temporary while thatin the steel nails is permanent.

## 8.5 Magnetic Fields

When a magnet attracts a certain magnetic material, it exerts some force to do so. Similarly, when it attracts or repels a magnetic pole of another magnet, it exerts a force on it. This force can be observed up to a certain distance from the magnet that can be explained by the concept of magnetic field around the magnet.

Amagnetic field is the region around a magnet where an other magnetic object experiences a force on it.

The pattern of a magnetic field around a bar magnet can be seen very easily by a simple experiment.

Fig.8.7

<!-- image -->

If iron filings are sprinkled on a thin glass plate placed over a bar magnet, the filings become tiny magnets through magnetic induction. Now if the glass correspond to the path of the filings. These lines are called magnetic lines of force.

## Magnetic lines of Force

The magnetic lines of force around a bar magnet can be drawn by using a small compass. The needle of the compass will move along the magnetic lines of force. Figure. 8.8 shows the magnetic lines of force around a bar magnet drawn by this method. The compass needle is symbolized by an arrow being the north pole (Fig. 8.9).

The magnetic field at a point has both a magnitude and a direction.

<!-- image -->

The direction ofthe magneticfield at any point inspace is the direction indicated by the N-pole of a magnetic compass needle placed at that point.

Figure. 8.8 also shows that the field lines appear to originate from the north pole and end on the south pole. Actually, the magnetic field extends in

## Strength of the Magnetic Field

magnetic lines of force passing through unit area placed perpendicular to the lines. Thus, the magnetic field is stronger in regions where the field lines are relatively close together and weaker where these are far apart.For example in Fig. 8.10, the lines are closest together near north and south poles indicating that the strength of the magnetic field is stronger in these regions. Away from the poles, the magnetic field becomes weaker.

tboc

<!-- image -->

In case the two magnets are placed close to each other, their combined magnetic field can also be drawn byusing the compass needle. Figure.8.10 and Fig. 8.11 show the patterns of the combined magnetic field of two magnets lying with different orientations. In Fig. 8.11, point 'x' is called a neutral point because the field due to one magnet cancels out that due to the other magnet. Figure. 8.12 represents the field pattern of a horse-shoe magnet. The field is almost uniform between the poles except nearthe edges.

## 8.6 Uses of Permanent Magnets

There are many uses of permanent magnets such as:

2. Permanent magnets are used in the moving coil loud-speakers.
1. They are the essential parts of D.C motors, A.C and D.C electric generators.
3. These are very commonly used in door catchers.
4. Magnetic strips are fitted to the doors of refrigerators and freezers to keep the door closed tightly.
5. They are commonly used to separate iron objects from different mixtures. Flourmills use permanent magnets to remove iron nails, etc. from the grains before grinding.

6. In the medical field, they are used to remove iron splinters from the eyes.
7. A piece of permanent magnet is used to reset the iron pointer in a maximum and minimum thermometer.

## Applications of Permanent Magnets

Let us see, how some of the following devices use permanent magnets.

## A.C Generator

When a coil is rotated between the poles of a permanent magnet, the magnetic field through the coil changes and an emf is induced between the ends of the coil (Fig.8.13). On connecting these ends to an external circuit, an alternating current (A.C) flows through the circuit. Electric motor is the reverse process of electric generator. When an A.C is made to pass through the coil between the poles of a permanent magnet, it starts rotating.

## Moving Coil Loudspeaker

<!-- image -->

A voice coil attached to the cone of the speaker is slipped over one pole (N) of the radial permanent magnet as shown in Fig.8.14. From a microphone or some other sound signals in the form of varying (A.C) current passes through the voice coil that is inserted in the gap of permanent magnet. This A.C interacts with the magnetic field to generate a varying force that pushes and pulls on the voice coil and the attached cone. The cone vibrates back and forth to produce sound in the air.

## 8.7 Electromagnets

activity will show how electromagnets can be made and tested.

<!-- image -->

## Activity5

The teacher should divide the students into groups and facilitate them to perform this activity.

Take a battery of two cells,a switch, an iron nail, cotton (or plastic) covered copper wire, thread and a few paper clips.

Wind the wire over the iron nail to form a coil. Suspend the coil by means of thread tied to its centre. Connect ends of the wire to the battery through the switch as shown in the figure.

<!-- image -->

Keeping the switch OFF,bring some paper clipsnearto one end of the nail. Do they stick to the nail? Now turn the switch ON and again bring the paper clips near to the end of the nail. Do they stick this time? Does the nail behave like amagnet?Yes,the nail has become a magnet.Turn the switch OFF and see what happens to the clips.Do they fall down?What do you conclude from this activity?

An iron nail or a rod becomes a magnet when an electric current passes through a coil of wire around it. It is called an electromagnet.

When an electric current passes through the coil of wire, magnetic field is produced inside the coil that magnetizes the iron nail. As we have observed that the magnetic properties of an electromagnet are temporary, therefore, iron object remains a magnet as long as the electric current passes through the coil. When the current is stopped, it no longer remains a magnet.

If we increase the number of cells in the battery or increase the number of turns of the coil, we will observe that the strength of the magnetic field in each case increases. This will be indicated by the more number of clips held bythe nail in these cases.

## Uses of Electromagnets

Electromagnets are used in electric bell, telephone receiver, simple magneticrelay,circuit breaker,reed switches,cranes,tape recorder,maglev trains and many other devices. Functions of some of them are described below:

## Magnetic Relay

This is a type of switch which works with an electromagnet. It is an input circuit which works with a low current for safety purpose. When it is turned ON it activates another circuit which works with a high current.

The input circuit supplies a small current to electromagnet. It attracts the iron armature which is pivoted. The other end of the armature moves up and pushes the metal contacts to join together which turn the high current-circuit ON (Fig.8.15).

<!-- image -->

## CircuitBreaker

A circuit breaker is designed to pass a certain maximum current through it safely.If the current becomes excessive, it switches OFF the circuit.Thus, electric appliances are protected from burning. As shown in Fig.8.16, inside a circuit breaker, the current flows along a copper strip, through the iron armature and coil of the electromagnet. The electromagnet attracts the armature. If the current is large enough, the armature is detached from the copper strip and the circuit breaks. Armature Pivot Spring Copper Strip

## Telephone Receiver

Electromagnet

There is an iron diaphragm in the receiver under which an electromagnet is placed (Fig.8.17). The emicrophone of the telephone handset on the other side sends varying electric currentin accordance with the sounds signals. When the varying current passes through the coil of receiver on this side,it causes variation in the force of

<!-- image -->

electromagnet. As a result, the diaphragm over it moves back and forth to produce sound.

## For Your Information!

A wonderful use electromagnets can be seen in the Maglevtrains.The maglev stands fora magnetically levitated train.A maglev uses forces that arise from induced magnetism to levitate or float a few centimetres above the guideway.

Huge electromagnets are used in cranes at scrapyards, steel works and on ships. These are so powerful that they can lift iron and steel objects such as cars as shown in Fig.8.18. After moving the heavy objects to the required position, the objects are released by just switching OFF the current ofthe electromagnet.

## 8.8 Domain Theory of Magnetism

It is observed that the magnetic field of a bar magnet is like the field produced by a solenoid (long coil of wire) carrying current (Fig. 8.19-a &amp;b). It suggests that all magnetic effects are due to moving charges. In case of solenoid, charges are moving in the wire. The motion responsible forthe magnetism in a magnet is due to electrons within the atomsofthematerial.

We know that an electron is a Fig.8.19(b) charged particle. Also, each electron in an atom is revolving about the nucleus both give rise to a magnetic field. Since there are many electrons in an atom, their rotations and spins may be so oriented to strengthen the magnetic effects mutually or to cancel the effects of one another. If an atom has some resultant magnetic field, it behaves like a tiny magnet. It is called a magnetic dipole.

## Paramagnetic Materials

If the orbital and spin axes of the electrons in an atom are so oriented that their fields support one another and the atom behaves like a tiny magnet, the materials with such atoms are called paramagnetic materials, such as aluminium and lithium.

## Diamagnetic Materials

Magnetic fields produced by both orbital and spin motions of the electrons in an atom may add up to zero. In this case, the atom has no resultant field. The materials with such atoms are called diamagnetic materials. Some of theirexamples are copper, bismuth, water, etc.

## Ferromagnetic Materials

There are some solid substances such as iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, etc. in which cancellation of any type does not occur for large groups of neighbouring atoms of the order of 10'6 because they have electron spins that are naturally aligned parallel to each other. These are known as ferromagnetic materials.

<!-- image -->

The group of atoms in this type of material form a region of about 0.1 mm size that is highly magnetized. This region is called a magnetic domain. Each domain behaves as a small magnet with its own north and south poles.

## Alignment of Domains

The domains in a ferromagnetic material are randomly oriented as shown in Fig.8.20 (a). The magnetic fields of the domains cancel each other so the material does not display any magnetism. However, an unmagnetized piece of iron can be magnetized by placing it in an external magnetic field provided by a permanent magnet or an electromagnet.

The external magnetic field penetrates the

Fig. 8.20(a)

<!-- image -->

Fig. 8.20(b)

<!-- image -->

domains. Those domains whose magnetism is parallel or nearly parallel to the external magnetic field grow in size at the expense of other domains that are not oriented. In addition, the magnetic alignment of the other domains rotates and become oriented in the direction of the external field (Fig.8.20-b). As a result, the iron is magnetized and behaves like a magnet having its own north and south poles.

In soft iron, the domains are easily oriented on applying an external field and return to random position when the field is removed. This is desirable in an electromagnet and also in transformers. On the other hand, steel is not so easily oriented to change order. It requires very strong external field, but once oriented, retains the alignment. That is why, steel is used to make permanent magnets.

## ForYourInformation!

In non-ferromagnetic materials, such as aluminium and copper, the formation of magnetic domains does not occur, so magnetism cannot be induced into these substances.

The magnetism induced in a ferromagnetic material can be surprisingly large in the presence of weak external field.Insomecases,induced field is a thousand times stronger than the external field.That is why, high field electromagnets are made by using cores of soft iran of some other ferromagnetic material.

## 8.9 Magnetisation and Demagnetisation

There are two methods used for magnetising a steel bar:

## 1. Stroking

In this method, magnetism is induced in a steel bar by using the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. The steel bar can be stroked in two ways:

## (a) Single-Touch Method

A steel bar is placed on a horizontal surface. It is stroked from one end to the other several times in the same direction using the same pole (say N) of the permanent magnet. Every time the magnet is lifted up sufficiently high on reaching the other end ofthe bar (Fig. 8.21).

## (b) Double-Touch Method

In this method, stroking is done from the centre of the steel bar onwards with the unlike poles of two permanent magnets at the same time (Fig. 8.22). This method is more efficient than the firstone.

In both the cases, the poles produced at the ends of magnetized steel bar after stroking are of the opposite polarity to that of the stroking pole.

## 2. Making a Magnet using Solenoid

In this method,a steel bar to be magnetised is placed inside a solenoid (long coil of wire) as shown in Fig. 8.23.The solenoid should have several hundred turns of insulated copper wire. When direct.current is passed

<!-- image -->

through the solenoid, the steel bar becomes a magnet. The polarity of the magnetised steel bar is found by applying Right hand Grip rule which is stated as:

Grip the solenoid with the right hand such that fingers arecurled along the direction of current (positive to the negative terminal of the battery) in the solenoid, then the thumb points to the N-pole of the bar end.

## Demagnetisation of Magnets

## 1. Heating

Thermal vibrations tend to disturb the order of the domain. Therefore, if we heat a magnet strongly, the magnet loses its magnetism very quickly (Fig. 8.24).

<!-- image -->

## 2. Hammering

If we beat a magnet, the domains lose their alignment and the magnet is demagnetised. It is also called hammering (Fig.8.25).

## 3. Alternating Current

When an alternating current (A.C) is flowing through a long solenoid, a magnet moved out slowly from inside ofthe solenoid is demagnetised (Fig. 8.26).

## 8.10 Applications of Magnets in Recording Technology

Electromagnets have widely /used in recording technology of sound, video and data in the form of electrical signals through magnetization of a magnetic material. Most common magnetic recording mediums are magnetic tapes and disk recorders which are used not only to reproduce audio and video signals but also to store computer data. These materials are usually coated with iron oxide. Some other recordings mediums are magnetic drums, ferrite cores and magnetic bubble memory. We will discuss the process of magnetic recording on tapes and disks in some detail.

## Magnetic Tape Recording

Induced magnetism is used in the process of magnetic tape recording. Recording and playing head is a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core. The iron core has a horse-shoe shape with a narrow gap in between its two ends. Audio and video tapes are synthetic tapes coated with a layer of ferromagnetic material.

Sound or picture is converted into electrical forms as varying currents. These currents are sent to the head that becomes an electromagnet with a N-pole at one end and a S-pole at the other end. The magnetic field lines pass through the iron core and cross the

Fig. 8.27

<!-- image -->

gap. Some of the field lines in the gap curved outward as shown in Fig. 8.27.The coating on the moving tape and induces magnetism in the coating. This induced magnetism is retained when the tape leaves the vicinity of the recording head. The reverse process changes the varying induced magnetism into varying current that onward is converted into sound or picture.

## Hard Disk Recording

Hard disks are circular flat plates made of aluminium, glass or plastic and coated on both sides with iron oxide. Hard disks can store terabyte of information.

A magnetic head is a small electromagnetwhichwrites a binary digit (1 or 0) by magnetising tiny spots on the spinning disk in different directions and reads digit by detecting the magnetisation direction of spots (Fig. 8.28). The term hard disk is also used to refer to the whole of a computer's internal data storage.

<!-- image -->

Magnetic disk devices have an advantage over tapes recorders. A disk unit has the ability to read or write a recording instantly while locating a desired information on tape may take many minutes.

Electronic devices can be protected from strong magnetic effects by enclosing them in the boxes made of soft iron. We will describe it in detail in the nextsection.

## 8.11 Soft Iron as Magnetic Shield

Soft iron has high magnetic permeability. The permeability is the ability of a material to allow the magnetic flux or lines of force through it when the material is placed inside a magnetic field. When a piece of soft iron is put into a magnetic field, it generates a magnetic field due to magnetisation.

gap. Some of the field lines in the gap curved outward as shown in Fig. 8.27.The coating on the moving tape and induces magnetism in the coating. This induced magnetism is retained when the tape leaves the vicinity of the recording head. The reverse process changes the varying induced magnetism into varying current that onward is converted into sound or picture.

## Hard Disk Recording

Hard disks are circular flat plates made of aluminium, glass or plastic and coated on both sides with iron oxide. Hard disks can store terabyte of information.

A magnetic head is a small electromagnetwhichwrites a binary digit (1 or 0) by magnetising tiny spots on the spinning disk in different directions and reads digit by detecting the magnetisation direction of spots (Fig. 8.28). The term hard disk is also used to refer to the whole of a computer's internal data storage.

Magnetic disk devices have an advantage over tapes recorders. A disk unit has the ability to read or write a recording instantly while locating a desired information on tape may take many minutes.

Electronic devices can be protected from strong magnetic effects by enclosing them in the boxes made of soft iron. We will describe it in detail in the nextsection.

## 8.11 Soft Iron as Magnetic Shield

Soft iron has high magnetic permeability. The permeability is the ability of a material to allow the magnetic flux or lines of force through it when the material is placed inside a magnetic field. When a piece of soft iron is put into a magnetic field, it generates a magnetic field due to magnetisation.

Fig. 8.29

If a sensitive magnetic device is enclosed in a casing of soft iron, the magnetic flux gets established in the soft iron rather than the device. Thus, the device is shielded from external magnetic field.

Figure 8.29 can explain this phenomenon well. A soft iron casing (shell) is placed inside a magnetic field produced by opposite poles of two bar magnets. Since the magnetic permeability of the iron shell is higher than that of air, so the magnetic flux is established in the soft iron. As a result, the device is protected from the magnetic field. Usually, the casing is made with rounded corners to facilitate the magnetic field line up easily.

Soft iron is generally used in the cores of transformers and electromagnets because of its high permeability. In case of an electromagnet, and quickly lost when current is stopped. That is why, electromagnets are widely used in electric bells, loud speakers, picking and releasing iron scraps by the cranes and in many more appliances. The sensitivity of a moving coil galvanometer is also increased by placing a soft iron core inside the coil.

Science is a collective knowledge about the natural phenomena, processes and events occurring around us. The process starts with asking a question, how and why the things in the world behave as such. We try to look orderliness and of nature gave birth to a single discipline, known as Natural Philosophy now known as science. There was a tremendous increase in the volume of scientific knowledge at the beginning of nineteenth century. That made it necessary to classify the study of nature basically into two main disciplines.

- (i) The biological sciences which deal with the living things.
- (i) The physical sciences which are about the study of non-living things. Physics is an important and basic part of physical sciences beside other disciplines such as chemistry and geology.

## 9.1 Scope of Physics

Physics is the fundamental science that deals with the constituents of the universe, that is, matter, energy, space, time and their mutual relationships and interactions. It strives to understand how the universe works, from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest star and galaxies. We have studied some of the basic properties of matter, energy and their mutual inter-relationship in the earlier chapters of this book. We will discuss in detail the concept of space and time in the higher classes. Briefly, the space is the threedimensional extent in which all objects and events occur. It provides framework to define positions and motions of variousobjects under some force.

Do You Know?

This toy which worked by steam was invented by Hero, from Alexandria in the 3rd century.However, the people did not think of using such things for luxury and comfort in those days.

The time measures the sequence and durations of events. It is considered fourth dimension. For example, oscillating motion such as that of a swinging pendulum relies on the time interval that determines frequency of oscillations. Another example is the time dilation which is a phenomenon discussed by ultra-high speed compared to one relatively at rest. Physics explores how these fundamental concepts are inter-connected. For example, the theory of relativity explains how space and time arenot absolute quantitiesbut are related to each other. It describes the relationship between space and time and how they are influenced by gravity and speed, for example, the bending of light around

massive objects like stars. Another branch of physics, the quantum mechanic, explains the behaviour of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels. It is how the physics has applied its principles to wide variety of phenomena, from everyday occurrences such as related tomotion and heat to the extreme conditions found in the universe.

## 9.2 Branches of Physics

Due to expanding scope of research in Physics, it is usually divided into the following branches?

1. Mechanics: It is a study of motion and the physical effects which influence motion. It is based on Newton's laws of motion and gravitation and is often called classical mechanics.
2. Heat and thermodynamics: It deal with the thermal energy possessed by the materials and it is used when it flows from one body to another.

## 9.4 Interdisciplinary Research

Collaboration and interdisciplinary nature of science is essential for addressing the complex issues and challenges of today. By working together and sharing knowledge, scientists can achieve more significant breakthrough and contribute to a deeper understanding of the natural and physical world around us. It allows us to contribute to advance in technology, healthcare, environmental issues and many other areas.We need collaborated efforts because:

## (1) Solution of complex issues requires multifacet expertise

Many challenging issues, such as climate change, disease prevention and treatment, sustainable energy solution are of diverse nature. It is difficult for one discipline to address them adequately. Such as understanding and mitigating climate change require knowledge for meteorology, oceanography, physics, chemistry, biological and environmental sciences.

combat this challenge.

## (ii). Interdisciplinaryapproaches foster innovation

Combined different perspectives and methodologies evolve innovation breakthroughs that might not emerge working in isolation. For example, nanocreate materials and devices at the nano-scale with unique applications in medical, energy and electronics. In an other field of "artificial intelligence" the development involves computer science, mathematical logic, neuroscience, etc. The collaboration across these fields enhanced the development of intelligence systems and their applications.

## (ili). F Rapid sharing of knowledge and information across the globe

Sharing and collaboration of knowledge across the globe brings rapid advances in science. The online internet information exchanges, conferences and workshops provide platforms bringing together researchers from different fields to share their fresh findings, discussion and brainstorming new approaches. Collaborated research projects and research journals are also means of collaborate research.

Interdisciplinary research and collaboration lead to a more holistic such as that ofenvironment and space exploration.

## 9.5 Scientific Method

issue and problem solving regarding natural and physical world. It is based on the following steps:

1. Identify or recognize an issue ora problem.
2. Gather information through observations of its various aspects.
3. Propose an explanation or a guess work known as hypothesis.
4. Perform experiment or collect evidences to test the hypothesis.
5. Record, organize and analyze gathered data, plotting and interpreting graphs to reach at a conclusion which is called a theory.
6. Repeated tests of the theory to wide range of similar issues then lead towards the formulation of a law.

Some key steps are elaborated here:

## 1.Observation

The first step in scientific method is to make observations of natural processes and to collect the data about them.This may be done either by ordinary observations or by obtaining the results from different experiments. For example, it is our common observation that shadowof an opaque object is formed when it is placed in the path of light coming from the Sun or a lamp (Fig.9.1).

## 2.Hypothesis

On the basis of the data collected through observations or logical results i.e., it is assumed that nature will act in a particular way under certain specific circumstances. From the above example, we assume that because light travels ina straight line.

## 3.Experiment

Experiment is an organized repeatable process which is used to test the truth ofa hypothesis.

To verify the assumption made in the above example, four cardboards, each with a hole, are placed in a straight line, such that the hole in 1 card is in front of a torch. When we see through the hole in cards, we can see the light of the torch (Fig. 9.2-a). If any of these cards is displaced, we cannot see light passing through (Fig. 9.2-b). Thus, this experiment proves that light travels in a straight line.

Fig.9.1

<!-- image -->

## 4.Theory

After the successful verification of an assumption and with the help of careful experimentation, it becomes a theory and is applicable to similar phenomena.With the help of the above experiment, the assumption has Lack of been proved that light travels in a agreement straight line. So, it then becomes a theory.

It is a logical explanation of the causes and effects of an issue or an eventthat occursin nature.

## 5.Prediction

<!-- image -->

After the careful analysis of a theory, we can make predictions about designed to test the theory over and over again. If test result do not agree, hypothesis is changed or rejected.

S

ers

## 6.Falsifiability

It is a concept introduced that suggests a theory to be considered scientific if it also make predictions that can be tested and potentially proven false. The requirement of falsifiability ensures that theories are not based on vague, non-specific or untestable claims. It distinguishes scientific theories from false or pretended beliefs that cannot be experimentally tested.

## For Your Information!

<!-- image -->

In the 20* century, Albert Einstein declared that mass and energy, the two concerns of Physics, are forms of each other. His theory of relativity altered man's views of the universe.

When a theory has been tested many times and generally accepted as true, it is called a law. The law is such a statement regarding the behaviour of predict about other aspects of nature. From the fact that light travels in a straight line, we can predict that shadow of an opaque object, similar in shape, is formed whenever it is placed in the path of light.For example, the shadow of a ball will be round whereas the shadow of a rectangular block will be a rectangle. After testing the theory under different situations, this becomes a law of science that light travels in a straight line.

The theories or laws of Physics are man-made ideas about the way the things work. They are liable to be disproved or modified with the future advances in science which brings fresh facts and new insights about the natural and physical world.

## 9.6 Scientific Base of Technologies and Engineering

Science or to be more specific, Physics plays a vital role being the core of each invention based on physical laws and principles. Technology refers to the example,

- (i)Automobile technology is based on the principles of the thermodynamics
- electromagneticwaves.
- (ii) Laser technology is based on the principles of atomic physics. It is widely telecommunication and space exploration.

Engineering is the process of applying various technologies and scientific principles to design various instruments, tools and build things that help to meet specific needs in every walk of life. Engineers also consider factors like cost effectiveness and safety measures when designing various products. Examples include:

- (i) A civil engineer designs a bridge that can withstand strong winds, earthquakes, intense weather conditions and heavy traffic.

- (i) A software engineer designs a user friendly application of a smartphone.
- (i)An aviation engineer looks for lighter material which can withstand sudden and severe disturbances and extreme weather conditions during theflightof an aeroplane.

Though the science, technology and engineering fields seem distinct but they often work together.Scientific discoveries lead to new technologies and engineers rely on scientific knowledge for our benefits and comforts. They are the potent for change in the outlook of mankind in shaping life style and influencing our way of thinking.
