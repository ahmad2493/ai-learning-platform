## 1.8: What do you understand by the zero error of a measuring instrument?

(SWLGI,MLN.GI,2021)

Ans. By closing the jaws of measuring device, if the zero line of one scale (vernier scale) coincides with the zero line of its main scale (other scale) then there is no zero error. But zero error will exist if the zero line of one scale (vernier scale) is not coinciding with the zero of other scale (main scale). Zero error will be positive if zero line of one scale (vernier scale) is on the right side of the zero of other scale (main scale) and will be negative if zero line of one scale (vernier scale) is on the left side of zero of the other scale (main scale).

## L.118 Why do we need to measure extremely small interval of times?

（FSD.GI,2022)(DGKGI,2023）

Ans. In nature and also in physics, there are so many phenomenon which vary with respect to the extremely small interval of time and for their experimental measurement we need very precise time measuring instrument,We need to measure extremely small interval of times to calculate the time intervals of natural and artificial events.

## L12: What is meant by significant figures of a measurement?

(MLN.GII,SGD.GI,DGKGI,17）

Ans. All the accurately known digits and the first doubtful digit in an expression are called significant figures. Significant figure reflects the precision of a measured value of a physical quantity.

## L13: How is precision related to the significant figures in a measured quantity?

Ans. An improvement in the quality of measurement by using better instrument increases the accurately and the one estimated digit.

More significant figure means greater precision.

## Ans. Difference between Random and Linear motion:

## Random motion

## Linear motion

1. object is called random motion.

- linear motion.

2. The motion of dust or smoke particles. in thel2. Aeroplanes flying straight in air and objects air is the example of random motion. falling vertically down are the examples ofl linear motion.

## 4. Differentiate between the circular motion and rotatory motion. (GRW.GI,RWP.GII,019）(LHR.GII,022） Ans. Difference between the circular motion and rotatory motion:

## Circular Motion

## Rotatory Motion inia

1. The motion of an object in a circular path|1. is known as circular motion.

The spinning motion of a body about its axis is called its rotatory motion.

2. Motion of the earth around the sun andl2. motion of the moon around the earth are examples of circular motion.

The motion of the Earth about its own axis is rotatory motion.

## 5. Define Translatory Motion and Rotatory Motion.

## Exercise (Short Answer Questions)

- 2.2: Explain translatory motion and give examples of various types of translatory motion.

Ans. Translatory motion: The motion in which a body moves along a line without any rotation, is called translatorymotion.

In translatory motion the line may be straight or curved.

Types of translatory motion: There are three types of translatory motion.

- (a) Circularmotion

- (b) Linear motion

- (c) Random motion

- (a) Circular motion: The motion of an object in a circular path is known as circular motion.

Examples:

- A bicycle or a car moving along a circular track.

- (ii) The riders in a moving ferris wheel have circular motion.

- (b) Linear motion: Straight line motion of a body is known as its linear motion.

Examples:

- (i) Aeroplane flying straight ini air is an example of linear motion

- (i) Objects falling vertically down is an example of linear motion

- (c) Random motion: The disordered or irregular motion of an object is called random motion.

Examples:

- Motion ofinsects and birds is random motion.

- (i) The motion of dust or smoke particles in the air is random motion.

## 2.3: Differentiate between the following:

- (i Rest and motion.

- motion is also known as law of inertia.

Statement: A body continues its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line provided no net force acts on it.

- 3.5: Why is it dangerous to travel on the roof of a bus?

(FSD.GI,DGK.GII,2019)

- If a person travels on the roof of a bus, it would be dangerous because when a bus takes a sharp Ans. turn, passengers falls in the outward direction. It is due to inertia that they want continue their. motion in a straight line and thus fall outwards.

- 3.6: Why does a passenger move outward when a bus takes a turn?

(GRW.GII,MLN.GI,2021)

- When &amp; bus takes a sharp turn, passengers fall in the outward direction. It is due to inertia that * Ans. they want to continue their motion in a straight line and thus fall outwards

- 3.7: How can you relate a force with the change of momentum of a body?

- Ans. When a force acts on a body,it produces acceleration in the body and will be equal to therate of change of momentum of the body.We can write it as;

Change in momentum =final momentum-initial momentum

Pf-P;=mvf-mvi

Thus, rate of change in momentum is given by.

$$\frac { 1 } { 2 } \frac { \frac { P _ { f } - P _ { i } } { t } = m \left ( \frac { v _ { f } - v _ { i } } { t } \right ) } { a } 
 a , \frac { v _ { f } - v _ { i } } { t } = a 
 S _ { 0 } , \frac { P _ { f } - P _ { i } } { t } = m a . \frac { ( 1 ) } { ( 2 ) }$$

- P-P =ma. te

and Newton's second law of motion tells us that;

$$F = m a$$

By putting the value of F in eq. (l)

$$\boxed { \frac { P _ { f } - P _ { i } } { t } = F }$$

which is the required relation.

$$T = 1 0 0 \, N$$

- 3.9:

- Action and reaction are always equal and opposite. Then how does a body move? (swL Gl.2019)

- Ans. According to Newton's third law of motion,action and reaction are always equal and opposite in direction. But action and reaction forces always act on different bodies, so they do not cancel the effect of each other, and under this condition of forces the body moves irrespective to this, that action and reaction are equal but opposite in direction.

- 3.10: A horse pulls the cart If the action and reaction are equal and opposite then how does the cart move?

- Ans. As a horse pulls the cart, it is the action of the horse on the Eart, according to Newton's third law of motion, Eart also applies the equal amount of force as a reaction on the horse in opposite direction. This would be cancelled out, if both the forces act on one body, but these two forces act on two separate bodies so they would not cancel the effect of each other and the cart moves.

- 3.13: When a gun is fired, it recoils. Why? .

(RWIWPI,14）MNDGI15)(HRG8)

(GRW.9）W1

- Ans. Consider a system of gun and a bullet. Before firing the gun, both the gun and bullet are at rest, so the total momentum of the system is zero. As the gun is fired, bullet shoots out of the gun and acquires momentum. To conserve momentum of the system, the gun recoils. According to law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the gun and the bullet will also be zero after the gun is fired. Therefore the gun recoils.

- 3.14: Describe two situations in which force of friction is needed.

- (SWLGI,14)MN.GIRW.I,GD.GI15)(RWPGI,MN.GI,16)(DGKGI19) There are many conditions in which friction is desirable, two of them-is given below:

- Ans. (i Friction is needed when we write, we cannot write if there would be no friction between the paper and the pencil.

- (i) Friction enables us to walk on the ground, we cannot run on slippery ground. A slippery ground offers very little friction, Hence, any body who tries to run on a slippery ground may meet an accident.

(GRW.GII,2017)(FSD.GI,2019)

- 3.15: How does oiling the moving parts of a machine lowers friction.

- Ans. By making the sliding surfaces as smooth as possible we can reduce the friction and for this, we apply any lubricant such as oil in the moving parts of machine. It will smooth the surfaces which are sliding and hence reduces the friction between these parts of a machine.

- 3.16: Describe ways to reduce friction. （MN.GI015）SWLGIWPG&amp;GII016）(RWP.GI17)

Ans. The friction can be reduced by:

- (i making the sliding surfaces as smooth as possible.

- (i) making the fast moving objects a streamline shape (fish shape) such as cars, trains and aeroplanes. This causes the smooth flow of air around their bodies and thus minimizes air resistance at high speeds.

- (ili) using lubricants between the sliding surfaces.

- (iv)- using ball bearings or roller bearings. Because rolling friction is much less than sliding friction.

- 3.17: Why rolling friction is less than sliding friction?

（LHR.GI,DGKGII,BWP.GII14)

- (P,15)D6)(8)(H,WPD.1)(WGDGG2) Ans. All surfaces have pits and bumps and when two such surfaces are in contact. Then contact points between the two surfaces form a sort of cold welds. These cold welds resist the surfaces from sliding over each other. More is the area of in contact surfaces more would be the friction. In sliding friction more area is in contact. For example, when the axel of wheel is pushed, the force of friction between the wheel and the ground at the point of contact provides the reaction-force. The reaction force acts at the contact points of the wheel in a direction opposite to the applied force. The wheel rolls with out rupturing the cold welds. That is why the rolling friction is extremely small than sliding friction.

## 3.18: What you know about the following:

fixed on a stand. Let w be the weight of the block. The block pull the string downwards by its weight. This causes a tension "T" in the string. The tension T in the string is acting upwards at the block. As the block is at rest, therefore, the weight of the block acting downwards must be balanced by the upwards tension T in the string. Thus the tension T in the string must be equal and opposite to the weight w of the body.

- Limiting force of friction: (i)

$$F _ { s } = \mu R$$

Friction is equal to the applied force that tends to move a body at rest. It increases with the applied force friction has a maximum value It does not increase beyond this. The maximum value of friction is known as the force of limiting friction (Fs). It depends upon the normal reaction. (processing force) between the two surfaces in contact. And mathematically.

where co-efficient of friction = μ R =normal reaction Fs = force of limiting friction

- (ii) Braking force:

is a limit to this force of friction that tyres can provide. If the brakes are applied too strongly, the wheels of the car will lock up (stop turning) and the car will skid due to its large momentum. It will lose its directional control that may result in an accident. In order to reduce the chance of skidding, it is advisable not to-apply brakes too hard that lock up their rolling motion especially at high speeds. Force exerted by brakes is called braking force.

- (iv) Skidding of vehicles: needed. But .there is a limit to this force of friction that tyres can provide. If the brakes are applied

To stop a car or vehicle quickly, a large force of friction between the tyres and the roads is too strongly, the wheels of the car will lock up (stop turning) and the car will skid due to its large momentum. Its directional control will be lost and it would meet an accident, In.order to reduce the chance of skidding, it is advisable not to apply brakes too hard that lock up their rolling motion especially at high speed. Moreover it is unsafe to drive a vehicle with worn out tyres.

- (V) Seat belts:

In case of an accident, a person not wearing seatbelt will continue moving until stopped suddenly by something before him. This something may be a windscreen, another passenger or back of the seat in the front of him. Seatbelts are useful in two. ways.

- (1) They provide an external force to a person wearing seat belt.
- (2) The additional time is required for stretching seat belts. This prolongs the stopping time for momentum to change and reduces the effect of collision.:

## (vi) Banking of the roads:

When a car takes a turn, centripetal force is' needed to keep it in its curved track. The friction between the tyres and the road provides the necessary centripetal force. The car would skid if the force friction between the tyres and the road is not sufficient enough particularly when the roads are wet. This problem is solved by banking of curved roads. Banking of a road means that the outer edge of a road is raised. Imagine a vehicle on a curved road. Banking causes a component of roads prevents skidding of vehicle and thus makes the driving safe.

## (vii) Cream separator:

Most modern plants use a separator to control the fat contents of various products. A separator is a high-speed spinner. It acts on the same principle of centrifuge machines. The bowl spins at very high speed causing the heavier contents of milk to move outward in the bowl pushing the lighter contents inward towards the spinning axis. Cream or butterfat is lighter than other components in milk. Therefore, skimmed milk, which is denser than cream is collected at the outer wall of the

bowl. The lighter part (cream) is pushed towards the centre from where it is collected through a pipe.

3.19: What would happen if all friction suddenly disappears?

- Ans. It there was no friction then we could not walk on the ground. Noting would be steady on the an object motion. Every thing would be slide around would not be stopped. There would be no sound because the waves have to be transferred with air friction, many things would be just sliding and sliding.Infact,noting would exist in universe,without friction.

3.19: What would happen if all friction suddenly disappears?

- Ans. It there was no friction then we could not walk on the ground. Noting would be steady on the an object motion. Every thing would be slide around would not be stopped. There would be no sound because the waves have to be transferred with air friction, many things would be just sliding and sliding.Infact,noting would exist in universe,without friction.
- (BWP.GII,2016) 3.208 Spinner of a washing machine is made to spin at a very high speed. Because when it spins at high Ans. speed, the water from wet clothes is forced out through these holes due to lack of centripetal force.

- Centre of mass: Centre of mass of a system is such a point where an applied force causes the (ili) system tomovewithoutrotation.
- (iv) Centre of gravity: The centre of gravity of a body is defined as a point where the whole weight of the body appears to act vertically downward.
- 4.3: Differentiate the following:
- (i) Stable and neutral equilibrium (i) Like and unlike forces (i) Torque and couple

Ans. (i) Diffrence betWeen like and unlike forces: (FSD.GI, SWL GI, RWP. GI, 2018)(LHR. G, GRW.Gl, FSD.G,MLN. Gl, 2019)

## Like Forces

- Like forces are also called like parallel force
- ii. Like force are the.forces that have the same direction to each other.
- iii. A bag has a large number of apples in it, the weight,of all the apples is acted vertically downward so these all forces are in same direction, called like forces.

Weight of each apple Like parallel forces

- (i) Difference between torque and couple:

## Torque

## Unlike Forces

- Unlike forces are also called unlike parallel forces.
- ii. Unlike forces are the forces that are in the opposite direction to each other.
- ili. An apple is suspended by a string. The string is stretched by the weight of apple. Weight is acted downward but tension in the string is actedc in upward direction. These are unlike forces.

Unlike parallel forces along the same line

一

## Couple

- ii. To produce a torque we need only one ii. To produce a couple we need two unlike force atleast. parallel forces atleast.

(SGD.GIFSD.GII,RWP.GI,022)

- i. The turning effect of a force is calledi. A couple is formed by two unlike parallel torque ormoment of force forces of the same miagnitude but not along the sa me line.
2. the moment arm.,
- iv. Torque by a force is the product of force Fiv. The torque of a couple is given by the and its moment arm.
4. represents force and AB represents the distance between two forces. The torque produced by a couple force F and F separated by the total distance(AB),that is the couple arm.
5. product of one of the two forces and the perpendicular distance between them.

- How can a force be resolved into its perpendicular components? (Subjective Type Question)
- When a body is said to be in equilibrium? 4.6:
- For Answer see "Hamdard Imtihani Physics "9". Ans.
- (MN,GDI14）I16)WI17）WIWPG1）GRWGI)

A body is in equilibrium if net force acting on it is zero, and a body is said to be in equilibrium if the resultant torque acting on it is zero.

- 4.7: Explain the first condition for equilibrium. (Subjective Type Question)

(LHR.GI,GWGIWGGKGIGD.GIWP.G&amp;I,1）)BWP.I）

Ans.For Answer see "Hamdard Imtihani Physics "9".

- 8 Why is there a need of second condition for equilibrium if a body satisfies first condition for equilibrium? （MLN.G&amp;IGD.G&amp;GIW.GIGKGWP.G16）FD.G）

Ans.The first condition for equilibrium does not ensure that a body is in equilibrium. Consider a body pulled by the forces F and F2, the two forces are equal but opposite to each other. These forces are not acted along the same line as given in figure.

The first condition of equilibrium is although satisfied but the body has tendency to rotate. This situation demands another condition for equilibrium that is the second condition of equilibrium, a body satisfies second condition of equilibrium when the resultant torque acting on it zero. Et = 0

- 13: Why the height of vehicles is kept as low as possible?

Ans. Vehicles are imade heavy at the bottom and their height is kept to be minimum. This lowers their centre of gravity and helps to increase their stability. Because to make them stable, their centre of mass must be kept as low as possible. Therefore, height of vehicles is kept as low as possible.

## Exercise (Short Answer Questions)

- 5.2: What is meant by the force of gravitation?

（SGD.GI&amp;GII,DGK.GII,14）

（LHRG&amp;IGW.ISDIGG.G15）R&amp;GIFDGGD.IGKGWP6）

(LHRGGRWGMN.GW.G&amp;GII,GD.GIWP.GI1）MN.GIGD.GIIWP.I2）GGW.GIFD.G,GD.KG&amp;G3）

Ans. The force due to which every body of the universe attracts every other body is called force of gravitation.

## Do you attract the Earth or the Earth attracts you? Which one is attracting with a larger force? You or the Earth.

Ans. Yes we attracts the Earth or Earth attracts us. Our body is very small, as compared to Earth so, we attract the Earth with a very small and insignificant force. Therefore it is not felt by us.

Earth because of its larger mass attracts us with a larger and significant force.

(SGD.GII,2014)MLN.GII,RWP.GI,2015)(SWLGIIDGK.GII,2016) （GRW.G&amp;DGIWP.GIGKI,WPI17）(GW&amp;GGD.GGKG8） (LHR.GI,SGD.GII,19）(SWLGI,21)(FSD.GISWLGH,）

- What is a field force?

Ans. The weight of a body is due to the gravitational force with which the Earth attracts a body. Gravitational force is a non-contact force. For example, the velocity of a body, thrown up, goes on decreasing while on return its velocity goes on increasing. This is due to the gravitational pull of the Earth acting on the body whether the body is in contact with the Earth or not. Such a force is called the field force.

## Why earlier scientists could not guess about the gravitational force?

Ans. The first man who came up with the idea of gravity was Isaac Newton. It was an evening of 1665, when he was trying to solve the mystery why planets revolve around the Sun.Before this,people were not familier even with the word gravity then how scientists could guess about the gravitational force.

(MLN.GII,2016)(SGD.GI,2019)(MLN.GI,2022)

Ans. of the Earth acting on the body whether the body is in contact with the Earth ornot.uch a force is called the field force. It is assumed that a gravitational field exists all around the Earth and its direction is towards the centre of the Earth. The gravitational field becomes weaker and weaker as we go farther and farther away from the Earth.

(RWP.GII.2014)

## Explain, what is meant by gravitational field strength?

- The gravitational field becomes weaker and weaker as we go farther and farther away from the Ans. Earth. In the gravitational field of the Earth, the gravitational force per unit mass is called the e a yo ana  on penba si na si sd uei e  jo ns py pe point. Near the surface of the Earth, the gravitational field strength is 10Nkg-1.

- Why is law of gravitation important to us? 5.8:
- Explain the law of gravitation. (Subjective Type Question) 9
- (FSD.GI,MLN.GI,2014）(DGKGII2016)(SGD.GII,DGK.GII,022) Newton's law of gravitation is very important to us. Because life can not imagine without this. Ans. This is the force of gravitation which is responsible for the survival of every object in the universe.We can determine the mass ofEarth,density ofEarth and orbital speedof satellite only because of this law. Artificial satellites are used for communication purposes, and carry instruments or passengers to perform experiments in space. These satellites require centripetal force that keeps them to move around the Earth. The gravitation force of attraction between the satellite and the Earth provides the necessary centripetal force.

(LHR.GI,DGK.GI,BWP.GI&amp;GII,2014）

(LHRGI,GRW.GIIMN.GI,SWLGI,15）(GRW.GI&amp;GISD.GIMN.GI,SGD.GII16) (GRW.GIFSD.GIIMN.GI,SWLG,GD.G&amp;GI,RWPGIBWP.GI19）（SGD.G) (GRW.WPG2)DMII,D.WPWPI)

Ans.

How can the mass of Earth be determined? (Subjective Type Question)

(LHRGWPG&amp;GIDGKGIMN.G&amp;GIWPGSGD.G5）MN.GIWP.G&amp;GI1) (GRW.IM.GWGGD.GIW.G2）GRW.GIGD.GGKI） Ans. For answer see "Hamdard Imtihani Physics "9".

## l Can you determine the mass of our moon? If yes, then what you do need to know?

Ans. Yes, we can find out the mass of moon by using the law of gravitation. As weknow.

$$M = \frac { R ^ { 2 } g } { G }$$

To find out the value of mass of moon,we need to know, following factors.

Radius of the moon (R)

Gravitational acceleration of the moon (g)

Gravitational constant (G).

## 5.12: Why does the value of g vary from place to place?

(SGD.GI14）（(SWLGIGD.GIIWP.,15）（RGI,SD.GI16）

（FSD.GMN.GI,WGIDGKG&amp;GII19）（SWLII,GD.GI,22）（R.GIWLGIIWP.GII3）

Ans. As we know that the value of gravitational acceleration depends on the radius of the Earth.

$$g = \frac { G M _ { e } } { R ^ { 2 } }$$

Value of (g) is inversely proportional to the radius of Earth. This varies with height. By jncreasing height the value of g will decrease and by decreasing height the value of g will increase. This is the reason that the value of g is greater at sea level than at the hills.

44

5.13: Explain how the value of g varies with altitude.

(DGK GI,2015) (SWL GI, RWP G, BWPGI, 216)(SWL GI, 2017)(GR.GI, 01) (RWP. GI, BWP. GII, 2019) (LHR. GI, 2022)

- GM. This equation shows that the value of acceleration due to gravity g Ans.-As we know g= R² depends on the radius of the Earth at its surface. The value of g'is inversely proportional to the square of the radius of the Earth. But it does not remain constant. It decreases with altitude. Altitude is the height of the body or place from the sea level. The value of g is greater at sea level than at the hills. Consider a body of mass (m) at an altitude (h). The distance of the body from the.

centre of the Earth becomes R+h.

$$g _ { h } = G \frac { m _ { e } ^ { \cdot } } { ( R + h ) ^ { 2 } }$$

According to this equation, we come to know that at a height equal to one Earth radius above the surface of the Earth, g becomes one fourth of its value on the Earth. Similarly at a distance of two Earth's radius above the Earth's surface, the value of g becomes one ninth of its value on the Earth.

- 5.14: What are artificial satellites?

(FSD.GI,SWLGI,2014)(FSD.GI,DGKGI,2015)

(SWLGIGD.GIWP.I19）(LHRG&amp;GII,WLGI）)

（SWLG&amp;GIGKGI2）RGID,I,WGIWP.GK）

- Ans. Scientists have sent many objects into space. Some of these, objects revolve around the Earth. These are called artificial satellites.

## 5.15: How Newton's law of gravitation helps in understanding the motion of satellites?

- Ans. A satellite requires centripetal force that keeps it to move around the Earth The gravitational force of attraction between the satellite and the Earth provides the necessary centripetal force. This centripetal force is introduced by the Newton. So in this way Newton's law of gravitation helps in understanding the motion of satellites.
- 5.16: On what factors the orbital speed of a satellite depends?

（GRW.GIFD.G,DGKGI.GII1)GRW.GIWG,GD.IWP.G22）MN.GI）

- Ans. Orbital speed of the satellite depends only on gravitational acceleration of Earth and radius of the Earth. It is clear from the given formula. V。 = √gR 6
- 5.17: Why communication satellites are stationed at geostationary orbits?

(GRW.GIGKIWGI,14）SWLII15）（GWGIMN.GIIWG6）

(GRW.GII,2017)(SWLGII,2019)(GRW.GI2022)

- Ans. Geostationary satellites take 24 hours to complete their one revolution around the Earth. As Earth also completes its one rotation about its axis in 24 hours, hence, these geostationary ·satellites appear to be stationary with respect to Earth.

## Exercise (Short Answer Questions)

- 6.2: Define work.What is its SI unit?

（MLN.GIDGKGIGD.GI14）（R.G&amp;IFD.GIMNGIWP.GI5）) Work: Work is said to be done when a force acting on a body displaces it in the direction of the Ans. force.

Work=Force x distance

SI unit of work: SI unit of work is joule (J)

## 6.3: When does a force do work? Explain.

Ans. When a force acting on abody displaces it through some distance Sin thedirection of force as shown in the given figure,it does work on a body.

Sometimes the force and displacement do not have the same direction such as shown in figure.

Definition of joule: The amount of work is one joule when a force of one newton displaces a body through one metre in the direction of force.

(SGD.GII, 2015)

Work done in displacing a body in the direction of force

<!-- image -->

In this case, force F is making an angle (0) with the surface on which body is moved. Resolving F into its perpendicular components Fx and Fy as;

$$F _ { x } = F \cos \theta$$

$$F _ { y } = F \sin \theta$$

In case when force and displacement are not parallel then only the x-component Fx parallel to the surface causes the body to move on the surface and the y-component Fy.

Hence

W=FxS

$$w = ( F \cos \theta ) S = F S \cos \theta$$

Ans. Energy is used by us to perform many activities of life.

7.12:1 Why does the atmospheric pressure vary with height?

- (DGKGI1）（GW.GI,WPI19）GRWIGKG1）LRG&amp;GIIWPGI2） Ans. As we krow Earth's atmosphere extends upward about a few hundred kilometres with continuously decreasing density, and the pressure is directly proportional to the density, therefore as we going up,the atmospheric air becomes thinner and thinner,so,density alsoreduces.Even at a height of about 30km, the atmospheric pressure becomes only 7mm of Hg, (mercury) which is approximately 1000 Pa. It would become zero at an altitude where there is no air.

- 7.13: What does it mean when the atmospheric pressure at a place fall suddenly?

(GRW.GI,016]（MN.GI8)

- Ans. A sudden fall in atmospheric pressure often followed by a storm,rain and typhoon to occur in few hours time.

- 7.14: What changes are expected in weather if the barometer reading shows a sudden increase? (SGD.GI,2014)

Evaporation: Evaporation is the changing of a liquid into vapours (gaseous state) from the surface of the liquid without heating it.

Factors which affect on evaporation: The rate of evaporation is affected by the following factors.

- (i)Temperature (ii)Surface area (ili) Wind (iv)Nature of the liquid Evaporation causes cooling: As evaporation takes place, fast moving molecules escape out from the surface of the liquid. Molecules that have lower kinetic energies are left behind.

This lowers the average kinetic energy of the liquids molecules and the temperature of the liquid. Since temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of its molecules, therefore the temperature of the liquid decreases.

- Central heating systems in buildings work on the same principle by convection. 。

- The day-to-day temperature changes in the atmosphere result from the circulation of warm or cold air that travels across the region.

- Land and sea breezes are also the examples of convection current. 。

3. What causes a glider to remain in air? (SGD.GI,2014）（RWP.GI,SWLGIIDGK.GIL2015) M9）） Gliders ride over these thermals. The upward movement of air currents in thermals help gliders Ans. to stay in air for a long period.

4.

Differentiate between land breeze and sea breeze.

(LHR.GII,DGK.GII,2014)

- Ans. Sea breeze: On a hot day, the temperature of the land increases more quickly than the sea. It is because the specific heat of land is much smaller as compared to water. The air above land gets hot and rise up. The cold air from the sea begins to move towards the land. It is called sea breeze. Land breeze: At night, the land cools faster than the sea. Therefore, air above the sea is warmer, rises up and the colder air from the land begins to move towards the sea as shown in given figure. It is called land breeze.

5. Differentiatebetween conduction and convection. (FSD.GI2015)SGD.GI2017)MLN.G,2018MLN.GI, SWL GI,019)

Ans. Heat reaches us from the Sun through radiation process.

10. What is Leslie cube?Write the names of its surfaces.

(DGKGI,2017)

Ans. A Leslie cube is a metal box having faces of different nature. Various surfaces can be compared / using Leslie cube.

Leslie cube has four surfaces:

- 1.A shining silvered surface 2. A dull black surface 3. A white surface 4.A coloured surface Mention the use of Leslie's cube. (FSD.GII,2016)(RWP.GII,2019）

11:

- Ans. A Leslie cube is a metal box having faces of different nature. The rate at which various surfaces emit heat depends upon the nature of the surface, various surfaces can be compared using Leslie cube.

## Exercise (Short Answer Questions)

- 9.2:

Why are metals good conductors of heat? （MLN.GI,GD.GI,2017）(MN.GII,RWP.GIDGKG019）（SGD.GI1） （FSD.GI1,SGD.GII,2022)(SGD.GI,DGKGI,203） Metals are good conductors of heat because metal contains free electrons which can move from one place to another, by getting energy. At the hot end, they get energy from the hot flame and move towards cold end, transferring energy to the other atoms and electron by collision on their way. At the same time atoms at the hot end, start vibrating more vigorously and transfer some energy by collision to neighbouring atoms, eventually heating the other end.

- Ans.

- 9.3: Explain why:

- (a) A metal feels colder to touch than wood kept in a cold place?

- (b) Land breeze blows from land towards sea?

（DGKGI,2014）(FSD.GI,2017) (RWP.GI,2019)

- (c) Double walled glass vessel is used in thermos flask?

- (P) Deserts soon get hot during the day and soon get cold after sunset?

- So it cools down more rapidly as compared to wood. Wood is an example of insulator

- (b)At night, the land cools faster than the sea.

Therefore,air above the sea is warmer,rises up and colder air from the land begins to move towards the sea.

- has very lowvalue of specificheat. Itcools down andwarms up fastly.

- 9.4: Why conduction of heat does not take place in gases? Ans. Thats way the conduction of heat does not take place in gases.

- 9.5: Ans. Energy in houses can be conserved by using energy savers instead of bulbs.

- Switch off the electric appliances when these are not used by humans. ?

- Solar energy is used by solar panel in houses. The solar energy is converted into electric energy.

- The bottoms of cookingpots are madeblack to increase the absorption of heat from fire.

- Hot water tanks are insulated by plastic or foam lagging.

- provides insulation.

9.6: Why does transfer of heat in fluids take place by convection? (SWLGI,RWP.GI,2021)(MLN.GIL,022) Ans. Convection is a process of transfer of heat by actual movement of molecules from hot place to a cold place. As we know the intermolecular forces are less in fluids as compared to solid, due to weak intermolecular forces the fluids molecules can move from their actual positions and are responsible for the transfer of heat by convection process.

- 9.7: What is meant by convection current?

- (LHR.18）D.IPI19）GW.IWIIGD1）FD.MNG） Ans. The path flow or current which is used for the transfer of heat by actual movement of molecules for hot place to a cold place is known as convection current.

- 9.8: Suggest a simple activity to show convection of heat in gases not given in the book.

- Ans. An example of convection in daily life is when we use a fire place to heat our home, as the fire heats up the air in front of it, the hot air rises up as it is less dense and than in turn pushes the cool air down so that it is heated and then rises, this motion is called convection currents and is the reason why fire place air effective to heat us.

- 9.9: How does heat reach us from the Sun?

- (DGKGI2015)(LHR.GII,FSD.GIISGD.GI,016）(FSD.GI,017）) (DGK G, 218)(PGI, 2019) (LHRGI,FSD GI,MN,G &amp;GII SGD.G, RWPGI, 1) (SWLG, RWPG, ) Ans. Heat reaches us from the Sun through radiation process. 10

## 9.10:How various surfaces can be compared by a Leslie cube?

- Ans.A Lesile cube is a metal box having faces of different nature.

- A shining silvered surface

- A dull black surface

- A white surface

- A coloured surface

- Black dull surface is a good emitter of heat.

- A dull black surface is a good absorber of heat as its temperature rises rapidly:

- A polished surface is poor absorber of heat as its temperature rises very slowly.

- Larger is the area, greater will be the transfer of heat.

## 9.11: What is greenhouse effect?

Ans. thus maintains the temperature of the earth.

## Explain the impact of greenhouse effect in global warming. 9.12:
